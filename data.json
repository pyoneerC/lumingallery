One said Holmberg gave him money to film sex acts in the 1990s. The other man who spoke at the hearing was a cooperating witness who said Holmberg used his political power to groom them for sex. \n\n* Holmberg said in court that he traveled to Prague with the intent of having sexual contact with minors, that he liked massages and some involved sexual contact. He said he might have received a sexual massage from someone under 18, but he\u2019s not sure.\n\n* In one message, Holmberg sent a cooperating witness a link to a brothel in Prague with the comment, \u201cThe boys rent at around $60 \u2026 (sex is extra).\u201d\n\n* Holmberg was linked to the investigation of Nicholas Morgan-Derosier, a Grand Forks man who was sentenced in May to 40 years on child pornography charges.\n\n* Holmberg, a Republican who held the powerful positions of Senate Appropriations Committee chair and head of Legislative Management, resigned from the Legislature in 2022. He was indicted on federal charges in October 2023.\n\n* Ray Holmberg, 81, was a Grand Forks state senator for 45 years, and received a sentence that is longer than federal sentencing guidelines. \n\n* U.S. District Judge Daniel Hovland characterized Holmberg\u2019s conduct as \u201cegregious and despicable\u201d and said he didn\u2019t think the guideline sentence of more than three years was adequate.\n\n* \u201cFrom my perspective, this was not an isolated case and this is not a victimless crime,\u201d Hovland said. \u201cIt displays a pattern of very vile, sickening criminal behavior.\u201d\n\n* Holmberg was sentenced to *10* years.
