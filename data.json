It is possible that this was sabotage aimed at preventing that from happening. I'm not saying that this is what happened, but there is a possibility. It seems somewhat unnecessary to me, as Ukraine doesn't really have enough jets where lack of jet fuel would make a noticeable difference in the war, but what do I know, I'm no military analysist. Also if it was really Putin, why not hire a non-russian to do it? Unless he was sending some sort of message? Who knows. But, it's kind of weird for a Russian ship master to randomly hit a stationary tanker that just happened to be carrying fuel heading for Ukraine... a pretty remarkable coincidence.\n\nJust watched a youtube video covering topic (at the 6:00 mark) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcRLQwpBc1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcRLQwpBc1s)\n\nWas curious what kinda responses I'd get here.",
