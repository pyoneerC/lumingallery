                "I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever noticed what a barista was wearing aside from if they had an apron on or a hat of some sort.",
                "**Summary:**\n\nOver 1,000 Starbucks baristas at 75 U.S. stores have gone on strike since Sunday to protest a new dress code requiring solid black shirts and khaki, black, or blue denim bottoms.\n\nPreviously, employees could wear more varied dark colors and patterns. \n\nStarbucks says the change is meant to make its green apron more distinctive and create a more welcoming atmosphere.\n\nHowever, Starbucks Workers United, the union representing employees at 570 company-owned stores, argues that the policy should be negotiated as part of collective bargaining.\n\nWorkers also criticized the company for selling now-banned clothing styles on its internal site.\n\nStarbucks stated the strike has had minimal impact and criticized the union for not prioritizing contract negotiations.\n\nThe union has filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board.",
                "Is it really about the dress code? Or was this just the last straw in a line of other grievances?",
                "Hate when I try to order a coffee but none of the workers clothing makes their aprons color pop and I don't feel welcome and have to have a screaming mental breakdown",
                ">create a sense of familiarity for customers as it tries to establish a warmer, more welcoming feeling in its stores.\n\nI don't think that having every store and every person working there looking the same accomplishes this.",
                "I can't believe someone out there is being paid 90 million a year to think up stupid shit like this",
                "Buying new clothes for dress codes was one of the most stressful parts of working a retail job with a dress code. \n\nWhen I was making $10 and hour and my pants became worn, it was beyond stressful.",
                "Rest assured, if they were paying their employees well, the dress code wouldn't be a problem. This feels more like an extension of those gripes than a mere clothing concern. Either way, I'm happy to not give them my money.",
                "They don't even want people drinking their drinks in the store anymore. Why the fuck should customers care how \"inviting\" baristas look? Starbucks corporate wants us out of their stores.",
                "My old customer service job at a grocery store had little restrictions with their dress code. They provided the aprons and name tags and we just had to dress in some sort of presentable way (while also being safe).\n\nIt seems silly to me that other similar businesses wouldn't have something like this. The last thing I would be worried about when I'm getting coffee is if the employees look the same. The fact that Starbucks corporate is making such a big deal about this honestly makes me not want to go just off of principal."

Tim Walz, the Minnesota National Guard, Mayor Jacob Frey and Hennepin County Sheriff Dawanna Witt have all been briefed on preparations for possible civil unrest if President Donald Trump pardons former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin for his federal conviction of killing George Floyd.\n\n> Then, on Monday, when asked about the possibility of a pardon, Gov. Walz told reporters, \u201cNo indication whether they\u2019re going to do it, or not, but I think it behooves us to be prepared for it. With this presidency, it seems like something they would do.\u201d\n\nSo it doesn't sound like Trump or the White House have said anything concrete, but there seem to be *rumors* circulating of a potential pardon which is what is causing this preparation.\n\nThe good news: Trump can only pardon him on federal crimes, not the state ones. Chauvin still has a 22 year sentence to serve in Minnesota even if he is pardoned federally.",

                "My old customer service job at a grocery store had little restrictions with their dress code. They provided the aprons and name tags and we just had to dress in some sort of presentable way (while also being safe).\n\nIt seems silly to me that other similar businesses wouldn't have something like this. The last thing I would be worried about when I'm getting coffee is if the employees look the same. The fact that Starbucks corporate is making such a big deal about this honestly makes me not want to go just off of principal."
