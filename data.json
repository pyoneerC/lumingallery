I should also note their planned trip was for 5 weeks between Hawai\u2019i and California if that matters for anyone. Also, please remember I was answering a question about why the lodging was considered insufficient and how that led to deportation, not defending the policy and actions: \n\nI live in Hawai\u2019i and the backpackers posted their side of the story on Reddit (available in the backpackers sub). \n\nBasically they only booked for a few days out of their planned trip, with the intention of booking additional as needed. However, they didn\u2019t have the funds on them or something (it\u2019s not clear, they were just asked about how they were going to pay) and when asked how they\u2019ll cover the expense they said they work through virtual employment internationally. They also didn\u2019t have a return flight/connecting flights within the US booked, but they did have an onward flight to Asia booked. \n\nThis flagged them as coming to the country to work illegally and they were deported as a result.\n\nNot defending them being deported or how they were deported but they weren\u2019t aware how strict immigration is for the US and due to their more relaxed travel style in terms of planning, they accidentally answered wrongly (but honestly) in all the wrong places when asked.

I should also note their planned trip was for 5 weeks between Hawai\u2019i and California if that matters for anyone. Also, please remember I was answering a question about why the lodging was considered insufficient and how that led to deportation, not defending the policy and actions: \n\nI live in Hawai\u2019i and the backpackers posted their side of the story on Reddit (available in the backpackers sub). \n\nBasically they only booked for a few days out of their planned trip, with the intention of booking additional as needed. However, they didn\u2019t have the funds on them or something (it\u2019s not clear, they were just asked about how they were going to pay) and when asked how they\u2019ll cover the expense they said they work through virtual employment internationally. They also didn\u2019t have a return flight/connecting flights within the US booked, but they did have an onward flight to Asia booked. \n\nThis flagged them as coming to the country to work illegally and they were deported as a result.\n\nNot defending them being deported or how they were deported but they weren\u2019t aware how strict immigration is for the US and due to their more relaxed travel style in terms of planning, they accidentally answered wrongly (but honestly) in all the wrong places when asked. Even the German consulate got involved but I\u2019m unsure what degree that plays in anything.\n\nThey were sent to Japan instead of Germany because I believe they requested it.",

I should also note their planned trip was for 5 weeks between Hawai\u2019i and California if that matters for anyone. Also, please remember I was answering a question about why the lodging was considered insufficient and how that led to deportation, not defending the policy and actions: \n\nI live in Hawai\u2019i and the backpackers posted their side of the story on Reddit (available in the backpackers sub). \n\nBasically they only booked for a few days out of their planned trip, with the intention of booking additional as needed. However, they didn\u2019t have the funds on them or something (it\u2019s not clear, they were just asked about how they were going to pay) and when asked how they\u2019ll cover the expense they said they work through virtual employment internationally. They also didn\u2019t have a return flight/connecting flights within the US booked, but they did have an onward flight to Asia booked. \n\nThis flagged them as coming to the country to work illegally and they were deported as a result.\n\nNot defending them being deported or how they were deported but they weren\u2019t aware how strict immigration is for the US and due to their more relaxed travel style in terms of planning, they accidentally answered wrongly (but honestly) in all the wrong places when asked. Even the German consulate got involved but I\u2019m unsure what degree that plays in anything.\n\nThey were sent to Japan instead of Germany because I believe they requested it.",

This was not a professional failure; they murdered medics (a war crime), then buried them in a mass grave, and then \"lied to their command\" about what happened.  Now I'm not sure about that last part.  I'm pretty sure IDF command would have approved of this war crime anyway.",

Breaches of orders, blatant lies afterwards and they claim everything the soldiers did was actually fine?\n\nAlso what is with the repeated false statements getting a pass? Its not plausible they did not notice the flashing lights. If they didn't do anything wrong why crush the vehicles or lie about the incident?\n\nFinally if they let their soldiers breach orders but escape punishment when that breach kills medic, the actual message is clear: killing medics is okay with the leadership.",
