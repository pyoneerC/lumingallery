She can't call someone named Robert, \"Bobby\", unless she has a signed note by the parents allowing it. No, I'm not joking.\n\nShe also teaches 8 non-verbal special needs students, that have so far cut her face several times, choked her (kindergarten), and given her several bloody lips. These are kindergarteners. Many don't even live in a house, they live in shelters, or in a vehicle. The schools have codewords for those students, and offer no help. My wife is the one that gives them the stability their lives lack, and her thanks is being given more and more non-verbal, no IEP (they have no special education plan) and that makes it near impossible to teach the OTHER 30 kids in her class. She's also forced to teach them all together. So while one kid is hitting another, another kid is ripping books, and another has now absconded, with no teacher's aide, she has to deal with all that at the same time. \n\nEducation in Florida is in real danger.",

The group says these gas turbines combined can generate around 420MW of electricity, enough to power an entire city.\n> \n> \u2026\n> \n>  But Musk has said he needs even more energy to deal with power fluctuation issues at the plant. When the first few methane gas generators appeared outside the xAI facility last summer, it caused a stir because the Shelby county health department and the Environmental Protection Agency said xAI wasn\u2019t using permits to run those generators.\n\nSo that's a total of 570MW of electricity, which could power 380,000 homes! That's energy which is burning loads of fuel, raising the prices of everything and producing plenty of pollution. All for a product that many people don't want but which will be forced on them when they use associated products and services.\n\nNot to mention that most of this generation is not currently permitted by the relevant authorities.",

I'm not exactly sure I trust their evidence when it comes to asylum seekers."

One of his biggest donors, a matter of public record, is the mother of the Atlas CEO, but whenever one of them is asked about if they feign ignorance and call it a conspiracy theory. \n- New Zealand has extremely high rates of child poverty, the previous government set up a school lunch scheme. David Seymours first large political act after getting into government was to dismantle the school food programme and replace it with slop from a company that was found to be serving horse meat. \n\nTheres so much more, unfortunately.\n\nHis party still appeals to way too many voters, especially fringe voters who feel unheard by the progressive parties or the very old and stale moderate conservatives.",
