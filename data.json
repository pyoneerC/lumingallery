Browning argues that most of the men of \u00a0RPB 101 were not fanatical\u00a0Nazis but, rather, ordinary middle-aged, working-class men who committed these atrocities out of a mixture of motives, including the group dynamics of conformity, deference to authority, role adaptation, and the altering of moral norms to justify their actions. Very quickly three groups emerged within the battalion: a core of eager killers, a plurality who carried out their duties reliably but without initiative, and a small minority who evaded participation in the acts of killing without diminishing the murderous efficiency of the battalion whatsoever.\n\n>While this book discusses a specific Reserve Unit during WWII, the general argument Browning makes is that most people succumb to the pressures of a group setting and commit actions they would never do of their own volition. \u00a0\n\n>*Ordinary Men*\u00a0is a powerful, chilling, and important work with themes and arguments that continue to resonate today.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, Orpo must stand for Orlando Police",

Their dog was a filthy matted mess who looked more like a rescue off of the streets. He had pooped and peed all over the house and there were mouse droppings in their fridge.

Browning argues that most of the men of \u00a0RPB 101 were not fanatical\u00a0Nazis but, rather, ordinary middle-aged, working-class men who committed these atrocities out of a mixture of motives, including the group dynamics of conformity, deference to authority, role adaptation, and the altering of moral norms to justify their actions. Very quickly three groups emerged within the battalion: a core of eager killers, a plurality who carried out their duties reliably but without initiative, and a small minority who evaded participation in the acts of killing without diminishing the murderous efficiency of the battalion whatsoever.\n\n>While this book discusses a specific Reserve Unit during WWII, the general argument Browning makes is that most people succumb to the pressures of a group setting and commit actions they would never do of their own volition. \u00a0\n\n>*Ordinary Men*\u00a0is a powerful, chilling, and important work with themes and arguments that continue to resonate today.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, Orpo must stand for Orlando Police",

Browning argues that most of the men of \u00a0RPB 101 were not fanatical\u00a0Nazis but, rather, ordinary middle-aged, working-class men who committed these atrocities out of a mixture of motives, including the group dynamics of conformity, deference to authority, role adaptation, and the altering of moral norms to justify their actions. Very quickly three groups emerged within the battalion: a core of eager killers, a plurality who carried out their duties reliably but without initiative, and a small minority who evaded participation in the acts of killing without diminishing the murderous efficiency of the battalion whatsoever.\n\n>While this book discusses a specific Reserve Unit during WWII, the general argument Browning makes is that most people succumb to the pressures of a group setting and commit actions they would never do of their own volition. \u00a0\n\n>*Ordinary Men*\u00a0is a powerful, chilling, and important work with themes and arguments that continue to resonate today.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, Orpo must stand for Orlando Police",
