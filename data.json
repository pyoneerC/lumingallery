                "Absolutely nuts \n\n> NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A Brooklyn woman said she feared for her life as she was chased, kicked, spit at and pelted with objects by a mob of Orthodox Jewish men who mistook her as a participant in a protest against Israel\u2019s far-right security minister.\n\n-\n\n> The woman, a neighborhood resident in her 30s, told The Associated Press she learned of the protest after hearing police helicopters over her apartment. She walked over to investigate around 10:30 p.m. but by then the protest had mostly disbursed. Not wanting to be filmed, she covered her face with a scarf.\n\n>\u201cAs soon as I pulled up my scarf, a group of 100 men came over immediately and encircled me,\u201d said the woman, who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity because she feared for her safety.\n\n>\u2018I had nowhere to go\u2019\n\n>\u201cThey were shouting at me, threatening to rape me, chanting \u2018death to Arabs.\u2019 I thought the police would protect me from the mob, but they did nothing to intervene,\u201d she said.\n\n>As the chants grew in intensity, a lone police officer tried to escort her to safety. They were followed for blocks by hundreds of men and boys jeering in Hebrew and English.\n\n>Video shows two of the men kicking her in the back, another hurling a traffic cone into her head and a fourth pushing a trash can into her.\n\n>\u201cThis is America,\u201d one of the men can be heard saying. \u201cWe got Israel. We got an Army now.\u201d\n\n>At one point, she and the police officer were nearly cornered against a building, the video shows.\n\n>\u201cI felt sheer terror,\u201d the woman recalled. \u201cI realized at that point that I couldn\u2019t lead this mob of men to my home. I had nowhere to go. I didn\u2019t know what to do. I was just terrified.\u201d",

I actually worked at Disney a few years back, and the company definitely takes its policies very seriously, especially when it comes to employee behavior and ethics. While I was there, I remember being told about the strict code of conduct and the zero-tolerance stance on things like theft, fraud, or any kind of misconduct. It seemed pretty over the top at times, but seeing stories like this makes me realize how real and serious their enforcement is. I never thought someone would go to prison for something related to the company, though, but I guess it just shows how far they\u2019re willing to go to protect their brand and assets.\n\nHonestly, this whole situation makes me feel kind of conflicted. On one hand, I can see how someone in a position of desperation or frustration might act irrationally, but on the other hand, stealing from a company as big as Disney doesn\u2019t seem like a smart decision at all. I wonder what led this person to make that choice\u2014whether it was a sense of entitlement or if they just didn\u2019t think the consequences would be that severe. Either way, it\u2019s crazy to think that a single bad decision can end up costing so much more than expected, especially when it's something as large-scale as Disney."
