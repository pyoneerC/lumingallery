                "#Card Skimmers on the Rise in Pittsburgh as Police Urge Shoppers to \u2018Tug, Tap and Track\u2019\n\nIt takes seconds to fill up your tank or grab a snack from the local shop, but that quick stop could cost you dearly if a credit card skimmer is lurking nearby. In the Pittsburgh area, these sneaky devices are showing up more and more, blending in so perfectly with the real machines that even the sharpest eyes might miss them.\n\nCriminals are getting bolder, popping skimmers onto cash machines and card readers at petrol stations and convenience stores with the kind of ease that would make a magician jealous. One such case in West Mifflin, just outside Pittsburgh, has police scratching their heads and combing through hours of CCTV in the hope of catching whoever planted a skimmer at a 7-Eleven on Camp Hollow Road. The image of the dodgy device soon did the rounds on social media, raising eyebrows and awareness in equal measure.\n\nPolice Chief Gregory McCulloch says it is often ordinary people who sound the alarm. A customer might notice something that doesn\u2019t feel quite right with a card reader or later spot an unfamiliar charge on their statement. From there, it becomes a painstaking job for detectives, especially since many of the culprits are not local. These crooks often use Bluetooth to gather the stolen data, never even setting foot inside the shop again. They just park nearby and collect the loot wirelessly.\n\nThe FBI reckons these skimming scams cost banks and consumers over a billion dollars a year, and part of the problem is how difficult they are to spot. According to Chief McCulloch, your hands are your best defence. Forget looking, it is all about feeling. If something seems loose or out of place, give it a good tug. In one case, a suspicious shopper did just that and the fake device came right off. Simple as that.\n\nThese skimmers are clever little things. They slide over the existing card slot and have a tiny computer chip inside that grabs all your information the moment you swipe. Just like that, your bank details are in the hands of someone who has no business knowing them.\n\nMcCulloch recommends remembering three little words: tug, tap and track. Tug at the card reader before you use it. Tap to pay whenever you can, since using contactless helps you steer clear of dodgy readers altogether. And track your bank statements like a hawk. The sooner you spot a charge you didn\u2019t make, the better your chances of shutting it down before the damage piles up.\n\nAs technology gets smarter, so do the criminals. But a bit of caution, a quick check, and a habit of keeping an eye on your accounts can go a long way. Because while these skimmers might be hard to see, the trouble they cause is crystal clear.",

                "#Card Skimmers on the Rise in Pittsburgh as Police Urge Shoppers to \u2018Tug, Tap and Track\u2019\n\nIt takes seconds to fill up your tank or grab a snack from the local shop, but that quick stop could cost you dearly if a credit card skimmer is lurking nearby. In the Pittsburgh area, these sneaky devices are showing up more and more, blending in so perfectly with the real machines that even the sharpest eyes might miss them.\n\nCriminals are getting bolder, popping skimmers onto cash machines and card readers at petrol stations and convenience stores with the kind of ease that would make a magician jealous. One such case in West Mifflin, just outside Pittsburgh, has police scratching their heads and combing through hours of CCTV in the hope of catching whoever planted a skimmer at a 7-Eleven on Camp Hollow Road. The image of the dodgy device soon did the rounds on social media, raising eyebrows and awareness in equal measure.\n\nPolice Chief Gregory McCulloch says it is often ordinary people who sound the alarm. A customer might notice something that doesn\u2019t feel quite right with a card reader or later spot an unfamiliar charge on their statement. From there, it becomes a painstaking job for detectives, especially since many of the culprits are not local. These crooks often use Bluetooth to gather the stolen data, never even setting foot inside the shop again. They just park nearby and collect the loot wirelessly.\n\nThe FBI reckons these skimming scams cost banks and consumers over a billion dollars a year, and part of the problem is how difficult they are to spot. According to Chief McCulloch, your hands are your best defence. Forget looking, it is all about feeling. If something seems loose or out of place, give it a good tug. In one case, a suspicious shopper did just that and the fake device came right off. Simple as that.\n\nThese skimmers are clever little things. They slide over the existing card slot and have a tiny computer chip inside that grabs all your information the moment you swipe. Just like that, your bank details are in the hands of someone who has no business knowing them.\n\nMcCulloch recommends remembering three little words: tug, tap and track. Tug at the card reader before you use it. Tap to pay whenever you can, since using contactless helps you steer clear of dodgy readers altogether. And track your bank statements like a hawk. The sooner you spot a charge you didn\u2019t make, the better your chances of shutting it down before the damage piles up.\n\nAs technology gets smarter, so do the criminals. But a bit of caution, a quick check, and a habit of keeping an eye on your accounts can go a long way. Because while these skimmers might be hard to see, the trouble they cause is crystal clear.",
