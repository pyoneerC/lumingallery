                "Grant Hardin briefly served as the police chief in Gateway, a small town near the Missouri border, in 2016. He also held several other law enforcement positions in the state beginning in the 1990s. He was terminated multiple times, and trailed by reports of excessive force and poor performance. Hardin was a police officer in Eureka Springs, but resigned on October 4, 1996, after being told that he would be fired for falsifying a police report. He went on to serve as a constable for District 1 from 2009 to 2010 and 2013 to 2014. He later worked as correctional officer at the Northwest Arkansas Community Correction Center.\n\nIn February 2017, Hardin shot and killed 59-year-old James Appleton. According to an affidavit filed in the case, Appleton worked for the Gateway water department and was talking to his brother-in-law, then Gateway Mayor Andrew Tillman, when he was shot in the head near Garfield. His body was found inside a car. Hardin was charged with capital murder, but later pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of first degree murder and was sentenced to 30 years in prison. In court, he apologized, but never explained why he killed Appleton.\n\n>\"I wish I knew the motive. Grant Hardin is the only one that knows. He did not have the courage to tell it.\"\n\nWhile in prison, Hardin was tied to an unsolved rape case from the 1990s. According to an affidavit filed in that case, Amy Harrison, an elementary schoolteacher and the wife of a police officer in Rogers, Arkansas, had arrived at her classroom on November 9, 1997, to prepare for the week. When she was leaving, she was confronted by a man who raped her at gunpoint. The attack occurred around the same time as a community church service down the hall. After Hardin went to prison, he was found to be a match for the DNA.\n\nIn 2018, Hardin pleaded guilty to rape and had 25 years added to his sentence.",

I don\u2019t live in the area anymore, but it\u2019s crazy he got out. He was a very violent man. I even had a conversation with him at Gateway park. He used to sit there in the parking lot at nights and waited for high school kids to come in their vehicles to have sex, and watch. (This was fairly common) My best friend and his wife had this happen to them at the park. This guy is a certified freak, and I hope they find him.",

                "Grant Hardin briefly served as the police chief in Gateway, a small town near the Missouri border, in 2016. He also held several other law enforcement positions in the state beginning in the 1990s. He was terminated multiple times, and trailed by reports of excessive force and poor performance. Hardin was a police officer in Eureka Springs, but resigned on October 4, 1996, after being told that he would be fired for falsifying a police report. He went on to serve as a constable for District 1 from 2009 to 2010 and 2013 to 2014. He later worked as correctional officer at the Northwest Arkansas Community Correction Center.\n\nIn February 2017, Hardin shot and killed 59-year-old James Appleton. According to an affidavit filed in the case, Appleton worked for the Gateway water department and was talking to his brother-in-law, then Gateway Mayor Andrew Tillman, when he was shot in the head near Garfield. His body was found inside a car. Hardin was charged with capital murder, but later pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of first degree murder and was sentenced to 30 years in prison. In court, he apologized, but never explained why he killed Appleton.\n\n>\"I wish I knew the motive. Grant Hardin is the only one that knows. He did not have the courage to tell it.\"\n\nWhile in prison, Hardin was tied to an unsolved rape case from the 1990s. According to an affidavit filed in that case, Amy Harrison, an elementary schoolteacher and the wife of a police officer in Rogers, Arkansas, had arrived at her classroom on November 9, 1997, to prepare for the week. When she was leaving, she was confronted by a man who raped her at gunpoint. The attack occurred around the same time as a community church service down the hall. After Hardin went to prison, he was found to be a match for the DNA.\n\nIn 2018, Hardin pleaded guilty to rape and had 25 years added to his sentence.",

I don\u2019t live in the area anymore, but it\u2019s crazy he got out. He was a very violent man. I even had a conversation with him at Gateway park. He used to sit there in the parking lot at nights and waited for high school kids to come in their vehicles to have sex, and watch. (This was fairly common) My best friend and his wife had this happen to them at the park. This guy is a certified freak, and I hope they find him.",

                "Grant Hardin briefly served as the police chief in Gateway, a small town near the Missouri border, in 2016. He also held several other law enforcement positions in the state beginning in the 1990s. He was terminated multiple times, and trailed by reports of excessive force and poor performance. Hardin was a police officer in Eureka Springs, but resigned on October 4, 1996, after being told that he would be fired for falsifying a police report. He went on to serve as a constable for District 1 from 2009 to 2010 and 2013 to 2014. He later worked as correctional officer at the Northwest Arkansas Community Correction Center.\n\nIn February 2017, Hardin shot and killed 59-year-old James Appleton. According to an affidavit filed in the case, Appleton worked for the Gateway water department and was talking to his brother-in-law, then Gateway Mayor Andrew Tillman, when he was shot in the head near Garfield. His body was found inside a car. Hardin was charged with capital murder, but later pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of first degree murder and was sentenced to 30 years in prison. In court, he apologized, but never explained why he killed Appleton.\n\n>\"I wish I knew the motive. Grant Hardin is the only one that knows. He did not have the courage to tell it.\"\n\nWhile in prison, Hardin was tied to an unsolved rape case from the 1990s. According to an affidavit filed in that case, Amy Harrison, an elementary schoolteacher and the wife of a police officer in Rogers, Arkansas, had arrived at her classroom on November 9, 1997, to prepare for the week. When she was leaving, she was confronted by a man who raped her at gunpoint. The attack occurred around the same time as a community church service down the hall. After Hardin went to prison, he was found to be a match for the DNA.\n\nIn 2018, Hardin pleaded guilty to rape and had 25 years added to his sentence.",

I don\u2019t live in the area anymore, but it\u2019s crazy he got out. He was a very violent man. I even had a conversation with him at Gateway park. He used to sit there in the parking lot at nights and waited for high school kids to come in their vehicles to have sex, and watch. (This was fairly common) My best friend and his wife had this happen to them at the park. This guy is a certified freak, and I hope they find him.",
