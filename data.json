                "Even worse, it was not a licensed surgery recovery place. \u201cInstead, according to a Miami Police incident report, officers and fire rescue crews responded to the house the night of March 7, which they say was \u201coperating as an illegal post-plastic surgery recovery home.\u201d Inside, they found Ahmonique already dead, and showing signs of rigor mortis, an indication she had likely been dead for hours. They described finding her as heavily bandaged, face down on a bed.\u201d how awful.",
                "I'm a doctor in North Florida. I have a lot of patients who don't have great insurance but want to have different plastic surgery procedures done and they travel down to Miami to get it done. I'm honestly not sure if it's just one group that does this or if there's several that compete. But apparently they have cheaper cash rates or some sort of payment plan that they can afford. I've had more complications from those handful of patients that go there than all of my other patients who've ever had it done locally have had. The problem is is it's difficult when there is a complication for a surgeon here to want to take on another doctor's mess that was from down 5 hours away at best. \n\nEvery time one of my patients says they're going to do that or looking at doing it. I try to talk them out of it. But I guess the price is just too good down there and they don't consider it a risk. I'll share this story with them from now on.",
                "Hopefully these stories are a reminder that plastic surgeries are no joke. Not something to try on a whim at a discount",
                "The amount of younger gals with clear signs of surgery at the gym and younger guys with clear signs of steroids is growing like crazy . Most don't even make any significant gains .",
                "Everyone is focused on the plastic surgery aspect and not that this was a \u201cRecovery House\u201d which generally advertise caring for patients post-op. \n\nYou\u2019d be surprised at the number of people who use these services for non-elective procedures as well. Not everyone who has surgery has a support network to care for them and hospitals will not perform surgery unless you can be discharged into someone\u2019s care. So while it is true these \u201crecovery houses\u201d often care for plastic surgery patients, I\u2019ve seen them used by folks who needed non-elective surgeries. And no, you can\u2019t just call an uber driver to take you home because you have to be discharged with someone who can actually take care of you post-op. \n\nThere\u2019s minimal regulations and this is going to be another case where the new regulations are written in blood.",
                "It's not actually clear that a license is required for a \"recovery house\" for plastic surgery patients in Florida. The only info I can find refers to \"sober living homes,\" halfway houses, or debt recovery businesses. Even the 2024 Florida Statutes governing \"recovery residences\" refers to substance abuse and addiction and says nothing about procedures such plastic surgery.\n\nOne would think something like this would be covered by licensing requirements, but we are talking Florida here after all.",
                "I\u2019ve got a lot of friends who are primary care providers. I\u2019ve heard so many stories the last 5 years about patients of theirs who travel to Miami for plastic surg, usually a BBL, and come back for follow up treatment. \n\nBesides the unnecessary nature of the surgery, there\u2019s a massive issue where these surgeons are having their patients pursue pre surg authorization from their family care providers for an out of state, out of network procedure. Then they often send them home far too early (day of), and push all post surg follow up care back onto the family care provider because the surgeon discharged them and said they were good to go home and to talk to their family care provide. The patients aren\u2019t going to hop a flight back to Miami for care, so family med gets stuck with being cornered on taking out sutures and providing follow up care. It\u2019s taking a massive liability for something they\u2019re not really part of and it\u2019s frustrating for them to say the least.",
                "\u201cSo, I don\u2019t understand. Where is the legislation? Where is the follow-up? \u2026Where is the outrage?\u201d McLawrence asked, citing NBC6\u2019s previous reporting.\u201d\n\nIn Florida?",
                "Although the recovery house was unlicensed, I still think this has to do with BBL not being a safe procedure. It doesnt specify what surgery she got, but needing a recovery house in general means it was definitely something major",
                "I\u2019d love to know if complication from the surgery is what caused her death, or if she was killed by the medication provided to her at the recovery home."

I've had more complications from those handful of patients that go there than all of my other patients who've ever had it done locally have had. The problem is is it's difficult when there is a complication for a surgeon here to want to take on another doctor's mess that was from down 5 hours away at best. \n\nEvery time one of my patients says they're going to do that or looking at doing it.

Then they often send them home far too early (day of), and push all post surg follow up care back onto the family care provider because the surgeon discharged them and said they were good to go home and to talk to their family care provide. The patients aren\u2019t going to hop a flight back to Miami for care, so family med gets stuck with being cornered on taking out sutures and providing follow up care.
