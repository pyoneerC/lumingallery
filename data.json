Don\u2019t give in to pressure to act immediately.\n>* Scammers like to be paid in cryptocurrency, gift card, or through peer-to-peer payment services. Never pay people you don\u2019t know by those payment methods\n>* Scammers use technology to mask or spoof their telephone numbers. Caller ID can no longer be relied upon\n>* Law enforcement will never contact you and demand money",
