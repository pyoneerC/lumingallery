                "I remember how final fantasy xii had this entire subplot about how the bujerbans were training rebels under the guise of military exercises and sending them out to raid archades, which led to continued escalation because a lot of the bujerban rebels were actually just deniable rosarrian assets for the rosarian empire. the idea being bujerba harbored and trained them as bujerban military then they'd go out and raid archades as an independent faction of \"rebels\" under no specific flag.\n\n\nvayne solidor's solution to this was to take a giant fuckoff tornado generating magic sky fortress called sky fortress bahamut and eviscerate them over the skies of dalmasca in what was supposed to be a devastating, violent blow to the pretext of the rosarian invasion. vayne was already in a bad place having killed his father and pinned it on the senate as part of a plan to take over the empire as an autocrat, so he wasn't ready for a group of pesky sky pirates and their playboy bunny mascot to suddenly slip into his heavily defended magic sky fort patrolled by killer robots and then single handedly beat his ass. \n\nbut the parallels between that overall plot and this is fascinating because the terrorists being harbored by the pakistani government feels like much the same situation, train a plausibly deniable military unit which will then repeatedly raid and weaken the nation. you don't dare break out into all out war over some pesky bandits, even suspiciously well equipped and well-trained ones. the indian government's response is about as blunt as vayne solidor's too, \"fuck the rules let's just blow them up to scare the fight out of them\"",
