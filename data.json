                "From [CBS News last week](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/who-will-be-the-next-pope-list-of-possible-candidates/):\n\n> Chicago-born Cardinal Robert Prevost is seen as having many of the qualities desired in a pope, and if elected, he would become the first U.S. pope in the church's history.\n\n> Prevost is the head of the church's Dicastery for Bishops, meaning he oversees the selection of new bishops. It's a powerful position, and for any cardinal electors who may be turned off by his American nationality, it's not his only one. Prevost is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Peru, where he served for many years.\n\n> Overall, **he's considered a centrist**, but on many social issues he's seen as progressive, embracing marginalized groups like Francis, who championed migrants and the poor. But Prevost opposes ordaining women as deacons, for instance, so he's seen as conservative on church doctrine.\n\n> His age could also be a factor \u2014 at 69 some may consider him too young to hold the church's highest office.",

Deputies were sent to a home near McKenzie Lane in the Washington, D.C., suburb following a call for a residential burglary in progress, in which a resident had fired shots.\n\nBosworth and another person had gunshot wounds, the sheriff's office said. Bosworth was taken to the hospital, where he died from his injuries. The other person, a juvenile, was treated and released. A third juvenile with them was unharmed, authorities said.\n\nButler, 27, told investigators that he believed the teens were trying to break into his home, NBC Washington reported.\n\nAccording to a search warrant affidavit obtained by NBC News, one of the teens told detectives that they were recording ding-dong ditch pranks for a TikTok video, in which they ring people's doorbells and then run away. The teen said that they had been to a couple of homes in the neighborhood and that he was not familiar with the area.\"\n\nAt 3am? They decide it's a good idea to ring people's doorbells? Not saying they should have been shot but how dumb can people be???",

One of the homeowners fired a few shots off after we had ditched their home and were running away. We didn\u2019t know if it was at us or in the air, but we def stopped playing after that day.",

It's a powerful position, and for any cardinal electors who may be turned off by his American nationality, it's not his only one. Prevost is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Peru, where he served for many years.\n\n> Overall, **he's considered a centrist**, but on many social issues he's seen as progressive, embracing marginalized groups like Francis, who championed migrants and the poor. But Prevost opposes ordaining women as deacons, for instance, so he's seen as conservative on church doctrine.\n\n> His age could also be a factor \u2014 at 69 some may consider him too young to hold the church's highest office.",

It's a powerful position, and for any cardinal electors who may be turned off by his American nationality, it's not his only one. Prevost is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Peru, where he served for many years.\n\n> Overall, **he's considered a centrist**, but on many social issues he's seen as progressive, embracing marginalized groups like Francis, who championed migrants and the poor. But Prevost opposes ordaining women as deacons, for instance, so he's seen as conservative on church doctrine.\n\n> His age could also be a factor \u2014 at 69 some may consider him too young to hold the church's highest office.",

                "I\u2019m surprised that doesn\u2019t happen more often.",
                "Oops. . .\n\nThe platforms need to demonitize these videos.  They're harassment.  A prank is putting googly eyes on all the photos in your mothers house or replacing the soap with potatoes.  It's not scaring the shit out of people or breaking the law.",
                "We've had teens do this to our house. They are not ringing the doorbell and running. They are full force hitting or kicking the front doors several times often until someone opens the door before they run. I live in a split level so they would also pound on the ground floor windows. \n\nWe basically staged a stake out one night. Saw them coming and called the cops. They got caught and we don't get \"ding dong ditched* anymore. \n\nThey're lucky we don't own any guns. I can 100% see these kids getting shot. It was terrifying.",
                "At 3am? Yeah, I can see why the homeowner would think they were trying to break in.",
                "\"The shooting happened around 3 a.m. Saturday, the Spotsylvania County Sheriff\u2019s Office said in a news release. Deputies were sent to a home near McKenzie Lane in the Washington, D.C., suburb following a call for a residential burglary in progress, in which a resident had fired shots.\n\nBosworth and another person had gunshot wounds, the sheriff's office said. Bosworth was taken to the hospital, where he died from his injuries. The other person, a juvenile, was treated and released. A third juvenile with them was unharmed, authorities said.\n\nButler, 27, told investigators that he believed the teens were trying to break into his home, NBC Washington reported.\n\nAccording to a search warrant affidavit obtained by NBC News, one of the teens told detectives that they were recording ding-dong ditch pranks for a TikTok video, in which they ring people's doorbells and then run away. The teen said that they had been to a couple of homes in the neighborhood and that he was not familiar with the area.\"\n\nAt 3am? They decide it's a good idea to ring people's doorbells? Not saying they should have been shot but how dumb can people be???",
                "Check their phones- I guarantee they were recording it.\n\nMy next door neighbor got a ding dong prank early last year- except instead of ringing the bell they donkey kicked his door and caused the glass to shatter. At 2 in the morning.\n\nGuns got involved. Fortunately none of the stupid kids was shot.",
                "I remember playing ding dong ditch as a kid with some friends. Lived in a country area where homes were further apart. One of the homeowners fired a few shots off after we had ditched their home and were running away. We didn\u2019t know if it was at us or in the air, but we def stopped playing after that day.",
                "to give some context this \"prank\" is common here where i live. this isn't simple ding dong ditch you guys simplify it. \n\nwhen it happened to us it was a group of four teens they rotated running  up to the door and kicking it. they know about the ring cameras and they know how to evade them. i was woken up at 3am with kids upstairs and my fight or flight kicked in guys. you don't have time to look on your ring. \n\nsometimes they also ring the doorbell but again many of these kids don't want to be identified so they cover their faces. again looking like a burglar. \n\ni'm not condoning the shooting i'm just setting some context for people to process what happened on both sides. \n\nit has shaken me and my family up. it's been almost a year and i still get ptsd and we have to check all the doors are locked constantly in what you would consider a safe suburb. \n\nit's not just a prank.",
                "\"TikTok\" + \"Prank\" almost always = \"You're doing something stupid that's likely to get you shot.\"",
                "I have weird military-related PTSD that triggers when unexpected people come to my house. \n\nI\u2019m ashamed to say I yelled at an old Jehova\u2019s Witness woman once for coming back after I told her not to. The unadulterated pure white-hot panic I feel when a loud knock hits my front door gives me days of depression. \n\nSo\u2026 I get it. You don\u2019t know what battles people fight in their private homes."
