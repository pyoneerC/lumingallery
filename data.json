                "Police in Sydney routinely conduct invasive strip searches at music festivals. We\u2019re talking completely naked searches where guys are told to lift their balls, girls are told to lift their boobs, attendees are told to squat and cough, bend over etc. Most of these strip searches don\u2019t find any drugs, and you\u2019ve got reports of innocent people being left completely distraught after this has happened to them. NSW Police are currently facing a class action over this. So far around 3000 people have signed up. A trial for that class action began today, hence the article.\n\nFor background: In 2001, New South Wales (state in Australia, Sydney is the capital) introduced a law giving police the power to deploy drug detection dogs at certain public locations, namely at major events such as music festivals, train stations and at venues that serve alcohol, such as pubs and clubs. These dogs are notoriously unreliable, and there are reports on social media of handlers forcing their dogs to sit in front people in order to have them searched.\n\nMusic festivals are the worst. The police have drug detection dogs at every music festival in Sydney. At these events, they\u2019ll have a fenced off compound setup with makeshift structures such as tents or ticket booths where people stopped by the dogs are taken to be searched. Some people are lucky enough to get away with a pat down, but in many cases, festival attendees have been ordered to strip completely naked and bend over, squat etc. to have their bodies examined for drugs. At any given event, they\u2019ll strip search dozens of people like this. Total gestapo stuff and it\u2019s still happening today.",
                "\"Parliament had made it clear strip searches were only supposed to be used \"in the most extreme of circumstances\", but that was not the way they were being executed by NSW Police.\"\n\nI know why, it's because you have perverts in positions of power and are abusing it for their own pleasure. \n\nShe was asked to strip, expose all parts of her body, drop her breasts, bend over and expose her anus and vagina, also ordering her to bend over while naked and remove a tampon. AND, a male police officer walked into the cubicle unannounced and observed the plaintiff in this position. Putting a woman through that because a cop had a \"hunch\"? Right. \n\nThose cops got off on it. Just disgusting behavior that should have consequences. This is not the kind of people you want in the police force.",

On the day she disappeared, she left home to pick up her pay cheque from the woollen mill where she worked.*\n\nI'm wondering what happened to her two children from that very early marriage. Anyway, the story makes lots of sense... she just hitch-hikes out of town with her baby-sitter... they split up and go their own ways...Backeberg out of state and lost almost forever.",
                "My grandmother effectively did this to her first two kids. her first husband was wealthy and influential. He was also abusive and controlling of her. He told her if she divorced him she would never see her children again. She left anyway and she wouldn't see her kids again until she was eighty years old after he died and her kids found out she was still alive (the husband told them she died). \n\nThe way she put it, the kids would have had a dead mother whether she stayed or not, so she chose to leave and live with the hope she would see them again one day instead of staying and either being killed by him or killing herself.\n\nEdit: I'm seeing a lot of comments under this arguing over different scenarios so I'll add more context to the story to help clear things up. \n\nMy grandmother married this man when she was sixteen and he was nearly thirty. She had her first son when she was seventeen and the second at eighteen. The oldest was three when she left.\n\nHer husband was a literal piller of the community type. Very wealthy, from a well-to-do family, very involved in local and state politics due to his business connections. Donated to the local police department to keep them on side, had a team of lawyers at his disposal, the works. \n\nMeanwhile my grandmother was from a poor family of nine growing up in a rural community. They had nothing and her marriage to this man (who she met after she participated in a beauty pageant, of which he was one of the producers,  and who asked to marry her mere months after said meeting) was seen as her and her family's way out of poverty. \n\nFrom how she described it to me, she knew she could not leave and keep her kids. Everyone she knew was local and she couldn't risk hiding out with them, it was the 50's and she had no job experience, she knew if she tried to kidnap her children she would be tracked down, labeled insane and put away somewhere where she would never see her kids again. She knew she would lose a legal battle for custody given her husband's connections, and she also knew the cops wouldn't help because one night she did call them and when she told them what was happening and her address, they hung up on her. He apparently beat her the next night because his buddies at the station told him she called. \n\nAccording to her, he never touched the kids, and she didn't think he ever would. What gave her that confidence, I don't know. \n\nHe granted her the divorce on the grounds she gave up custody, never contacted them again, never went public about what he did to her, and collaborated his story that he chose to divorce her due to her having a drinking problem and him not feeling safe with her around the kids. \n\nTo quote my grandmother as best as I can remember \n\n\"I thought about killing him and running away with them, stealing all the money I could from the house and starting over somewhere, but I knew I wouldn't get away with it, and my boys would end up living with his parents while I was thrown in jail. I had this mentality,  despite everything, that the boys deserved to have at least one of us around, so I agreed and left. My family knew the truth, but we never let it get out out of fear of him coming after us. I've had to make a lot of hard decisions in my life, but leaving my boys with him was the hardest thing I've ever done. I wish I could say I did it completely out of selflessness, that it was all for them, but there was always a part of me. A small, small part, that was just relieved I was free of him forever\". \n\nShe was so scared of him that when her sons contacted her  over sixty years later the first thing she asked was if their father was still alive. He had died a month prior to pancreatic cancer, they had spent the better part of a year looking for her after their step mother told them the truth. After learning everything from their father, who apparently became very truthful in his last days. they had no anger towards my grandmother for what she did. \n\nFor their father's part, he never abused them though he was very much a tough love parent with them while they were growing up which had already left them with a strained relationship prior to all this coming to light. They grew up very well off, both going to Ivy League schools. I know the one went into biomedical engineering I can't remember what the other did. \n\nThey would only meet my grandmother a few times before she herself passed away a year later due to a head injury from a fall. I only met them once and it was at the funeral. I haven't spoken to them since and neither has anybody else in the family as far as I know. Not due to hostility but simply due to us all having our own families and lives. \n\nI hope that helps clear any questions up.",
                "My father abandoned his wife of 6 years and 3 small children in 1964.  Literally went out for cigarettes and never came home.  The act completely wrecked the family: the kids were adopted out to other family members and the mom was never the same again.   \n\n2 years later in 1966 he met my mother, settled down under an assumed name, and had my sister in 1968 and me in 1973.  He took my birth certificate and created a new identity for himself (I never got a SS card until I was 12, and officially I am \"Junior\" even though my birth certificate says otherwise).  We found this out after his death in 2019, [when I found an envelope](https://imgur.com/t7LcmY3) addressed to me only, with 3 fake birth certificates, 3 sets of legit Social Security cards, 3 identities and a bunch of still-cryptic papers no one quite knows what to make of.  \n\nNo one knew.

                "Some people will condemn her for not taking her kids, but this was a very different time for women's rights. \n\nShe was only 19 and married to an older man. There's no telling if she even wanted to be married much less a mother. Dude was physically abusive so it wouldn't be a stretch to think he was sexually abusive too and birth control wasn't really a thing back then. Divorce without cause was illegal at this time so she would have to legally prove he was abusive. Considering she wasn't having any luck getting help when she reported the abuse, it didn't seem likely. \n\nBack then women couldn't legally have their own bank account or credit card. Jobs for women didn't pay enough to really support a family. And until the 80s it was legal to refuse to rent to women with children. \n\nShe probably felt it was hopeless to even attempt to take her kids because she wouldn't be able to provide for them and he would be able to use them to keep control of her. She was young, abused, and desperate in a world where women were very restricted in what they could do. It's important to remember that.",

The family lore goes that he left on foot one night to pick up his paycheck and a freak rainstorm hit and he slipped on a riverbank and fell into swollen, raging waters.  My great great grandmother experienced tremendous financial hardship and mental health issues after he disappeared and the children were farmed out to various family members to raise.  \n\nI developed an interest in genealogy and putting together the family tree a few years ago.  It was chilling to find a census record, over 10 years after his alleged disappearance and death, of a man with his exact unique name (first, middle and last), birth date, country of origin and profession, married to a different woman who was not my GG grandmother, with small children, living just a couple of counties away from the small Iowa town that he had disappeared from.  I have no doubt that this man and my great great grandfather are the same person.  \n\nTo pull off such a stunt today would be unthinkable."

                "Police in Sydney routinely conduct invasive strip searches at music festivals. We\u2019re talking completely naked searches where guys are told to lift their balls, girls are told to lift their boobs, attendees are told to squat and cough, bend over etc. Most of these strip searches don\u2019t find any drugs, and you\u2019ve got reports of innocent people being left completely distraught after this has happened to them. NSW Police are currently facing a class action over this. So far around 3000 people have signed up. A trial for that class action began today, hence the article.\n\nFor background: In 2001, New South Wales (state in Australia, Sydney is the capital) introduced a law giving police the power to deploy drug detection dogs at certain public locations, namely at major events such as music festivals, train stations and at venues that serve alcohol, such as pubs and clubs. These dogs are notoriously unreliable, and there are reports on social media of handlers forcing their dogs to sit in front people in order to have them searched.\n\nMusic festivals are the worst. The police have drug detection dogs at every music festival in Sydney. At these events, they\u2019ll have a fenced off compound setup with makeshift structures such as tents or ticket booths where people stopped by the dogs are taken to be searched. Some people are lucky enough to get away with a pat down, but in many cases, festival attendees have been ordered to strip completely naked and bend over, squat etc. to have their bodies examined for drugs. At any given event, they\u2019ll strip search dozens of people like this. Total gestapo stuff and it\u2019s still happening today.",
                "\"Parliament had made it clear strip searches were only supposed to be used \"in the most extreme of circumstances\", but that was not the way they were being executed by NSW Police.\"\n\nI know why, it's because you have perverts in positions of power and are abusing it for their own pleasure. \n\nShe was asked to strip, expose all parts of her body, drop her breasts, bend over and expose her anus and vagina, also ordering her to bend over while naked and remove a tampon. AND, a male police officer walked into the cubicle unannounced and observed the plaintiff in this position. Putting a woman through that because a cop had a \"hunch\"? Right. \n\nThose cops got off on it. Just disgusting behavior that should have consequences. This is not the kind of people you want in the police force.",

Anyway, the story makes lots of sense... she just hitch-hikes out of town with her baby-sitter... they split up and go their own ways...Backeberg out of state and lost almost forever.",
                "My grandmother effectively did this to her first two kids. her first husband was wealthy and influential. He was also abusive and controlling of her. He told her if she divorced him she would never see her children again. She left anyway and she wouldn't see her kids again until she was eighty years old after he died and her kids found out she was still alive (the husband told them she died). \n\nThe way she put it, the kids would have had a dead mother whether she stayed or not, so she chose to leave and live with the hope she would see them again one day instead of staying and either being killed by him or killing herself.\n\nEdit: I'm seeing a lot of comments under this arguing over different scenarios so I'll add more context to the story to help clear things up. \n\nMy grandmother married this man when she was sixteen and he was nearly thirty. She had her first son when she was seventeen and the second at eighteen. The oldest was three when she left.\n\nHer husband was a literal piller of the community type. Very wealthy, from a well-to-do family, very involved in local and state politics due to his business connections. Donated to the local police department to keep them on side, had a team of lawyers at his disposal, the works. \n\nMeanwhile my grandmother was from a poor family of nine growing up in a rural community. They had nothing and her marriage to this man (who she met after she participated in a beauty pageant, of which he was one of the producers,  and who asked to marry her mere months after said meeting) was seen as her and her family's way out of poverty. \n\nFrom how she described it to me, she knew she could not leave and keep her kids. Everyone she knew was local and she couldn't risk hiding out with them, it was the 50's and she had no job experience, she knew if she tried to kidnap her children she would be tracked down, labeled insane and put away somewhere where she would never see her kids again. She knew she would lose a legal battle for custody given her husband's connections, and she also knew the cops wouldn't help because one night she did call them and when she told them what was happening and her address, they hung up on her. He apparently beat her the next night because his buddies at the station told him she called. \n\nAccording to her, he never touched the kids, and she didn't think he ever would. What gave her that confidence, I don't know. \n\nHe granted her the divorce on the grounds she gave up custody, never contacted them again, never went public about what he did to her, and collaborated his story that he chose to divorce her due to her having a drinking problem and him not feeling safe with her around the kids. \n\nTo quote my grandmother as best as I can remember \n\n\"I thought about killing him and running away with them, stealing all the money I could from the house and starting over somewhere, but I knew I wouldn't get away with it, and my boys would end up living with his parents while I was thrown in jail. I had this mentality,  despite everything, that the boys deserved to have at least one of us around, so I agreed and left. My family knew the truth, but we never let it get out out of fear of him coming after us. I've had to make a lot of hard decisions in my life, but leaving my boys with him was the hardest thing I've ever done. I wish I could say I did it completely out of selflessness, that it was all for them, but there was always a part of me. A small, small part, that was just relieved I was free of him forever\". \n\nShe was so scared of him that when her sons contacted her  over sixty years later the first thing she asked was if their father was still alive. He had died a month prior to pancreatic cancer, they had spent the better part of a year looking for her after their step mother told them the truth. After learning everything from their father, who apparently became very truthful in his last days. they had no anger towards my grandmother for what she did. \n\nFor their father's part, he never abused them though he was very much a tough love parent with them while they were growing up which had already left them with a strained relationship prior to all this coming to light. They grew up very well off, both going to Ivy League schools. I know the one went into biomedical engineering I can't remember what the other did. \n\nThey would only meet my grandmother a few times before she herself passed away a year later due to a head injury from a fall. I only met them once and it was at the funeral. I haven't spoken to them since and neither has anybody else in the family as far as I know. Not due to hostility but simply due to us all having our own families and lives. \n\nI hope that helps clear any questions up.",
                "My father abandoned his wife of 6 years and 3 small children in 1964.  Literally went out for cigarettes and never came home.  The act completely wrecked the family: the kids were adopted out to other family members and the mom was never the same again.   \n\n2 years later in 1966 he met my mother, settled down under an assumed name, and had my sister in 1968 and me in 1973.  He took my birth certificate and created a new identity for himself (I never got a SS card until I was 12, and officially I am \"Junior\" even though my birth certificate says otherwise).  We found this out after his death in 2019, [when I found an envelope](https://imgur.com/t7LcmY3) addressed to me only, with 3 fake birth certificates, 3 sets of legit Social Security cards, 3 identities and a bunch of still-cryptic papers no one quite knows what to make of.  \n\nNo one knew.  We got in contact with our half siblings.  They are lovely people who have come to peace with the whole situation and are pretty well adjusted.  My sister and I are not and feel constant guilt over it.",

                "It reminds the character played by Julianne Moore in the movie The Hours.",
                "Some people will condemn her for not taking her kids, but this was a very different time for women's rights. \n\nShe was only 19 and married to an older man. There's no telling if she even wanted to be married much less a mother. Dude was physically abusive so it wouldn't be a stretch to think he was sexually abusive too and birth control wasn't really a thing back then. Divorce without cause was illegal at this time so she would have to legally prove he was abusive. Considering she wasn't having any luck getting help when she reported the abuse, it didn't seem likely. \n\nBack then women couldn't legally have their own bank account or credit card. Jobs for women didn't pay enough to really support a family. And until the 80s it was legal to refuse to rent to women with children. \n\nShe probably felt it was hopeless to even attempt to take her kids because she wouldn't be able to provide for them and he would be able to use them to keep control of her. She was young, abused, and desperate in a world where women were very restricted in what they could do. It's important to remember that.",

                "TLDR: She was in the last place they eventually looked.",
                "I have reason to believe that my great great grandfather did this, going so far as faking his own death to start a new family with another woman.  The family lore goes that he left on foot one night to pick up his paycheck and a freak rainstorm hit and he slipped on a riverbank and fell into swollen, raging waters.  My great great grandmother experienced tremendous financial hardship and mental health issues after he disappeared and the children were farmed out to various family members to raise.  \n\nI developed an interest in genealogy and putting together the family tree a few years ago.  It was chilling to find a census record, over 10 years after his alleged disappearance and death, of a man with his exact unique name (first, middle and last), birth date, country of origin and profession, married to a different woman who was not my GG grandmother, with small children, living just a couple of counties away from the small Iowa town that he had disappeared from.  I have no doubt that this man and my great great grandfather are the same person.  \n\nTo pull off such a stunt today would be unthinkable."

                "Police in Sydney routinely conduct invasive strip searches at music festivals. We\u2019re talking completely naked searches where guys are told to lift their balls, girls are told to lift their boobs, attendees are told to squat and cough, bend over etc. Most of these strip searches don\u2019t find any drugs, and you\u2019ve got reports of innocent people being left completely distraught after this has happened to them. NSW Police are currently facing a class action over this. So far around 3000 people have signed up. A trial for that class action began today, hence the article.\n\nFor background: In 2001, New South Wales (state in Australia, Sydney is the capital) introduced a law giving police the power to deploy drug detection dogs at certain public locations, namely at major events such as music festivals, train stations and at venues that serve alcohol, such as pubs and clubs. These dogs are notoriously unreliable, and there are reports on social media of handlers forcing their dogs to sit in front people in order to have them searched.\n\nMusic festivals are the worst. The police have drug detection dogs at every music festival in Sydney. At these events, they\u2019ll have a fenced off compound setup with makeshift structures such as tents or ticket booths where people stopped by the dogs are taken to be searched. Some people are lucky enough to get away with a pat down, but in many cases, festival attendees have been ordered to strip completely naked and bend over, squat etc. to have their bodies examined for drugs. At any given event, they\u2019ll strip search dozens of people like this. Total gestapo stuff and it\u2019s still happening today.",

AND, a male police officer walked into the cubicle unannounced and observed the plaintiff in this position. Putting a woman through that because a cop had a \"hunch\"?

On the day she disappeared, she left home to pick up her pay cheque from the woollen mill where she worked.*\n\nI'm wondering what happened to her two children from that very early marriage. Anyway, the story makes lots of sense... she just hitch-hikes out of town with her baby-sitter... they split up and go their own ways...Backeberg out of state and lost almost forever.",
                "My grandmother effectively did this to her first two kids. her first husband was wealthy and influential. He was also abusive and controlling of her. He told her if she divorced him she would never see her children again. She left anyway and she wouldn't see her kids again until she was eighty years old after he died and her kids found out she was still alive (the husband told them she died). \n\nThe way she put it, the kids would have had a dead mother whether she stayed or not, so she chose to leave and live with the hope she would see them again one day instead of staying and either being killed by him or killing herself.\n\nEdit: I'm seeing a lot of comments under this arguing over different scenarios so I'll add more context to the story to help clear things up. \n\nMy grandmother married this man when she was sixteen and he was nearly thirty. She had her first son when she was seventeen and the second at eighteen. The oldest was three when she left.\n\nHer husband was a literal piller of the community type. Very wealthy, from a well-to-do family, very involved in local and state politics due to his business connections. Donated to the local police department to keep them on side, had a team of lawyers at his disposal, the works. \n\nMeanwhile my grandmother was from a poor family of nine growing up in a rural community. They had nothing and her marriage to this man (who she met after she participated in a beauty pageant, of which he was one of the producers,  and who asked to marry her mere months after said meeting) was seen as her and her family's way out of poverty. \n\nFrom how she described it to me, she knew she could not leave and keep her kids. Everyone she knew was local and she couldn't risk hiding out with them, it was the 50's and she had no job experience, she knew if she tried to kidnap her children she would be tracked down, labeled insane and put away somewhere where she would never see her kids again. She knew she would lose a legal battle for custody given her husband's connections, and she also knew the cops wouldn't help because one night she did call them and when she told them what was happening and her address, they hung up on her. He apparently beat her the next night because his buddies at the station told him she called. \n\nAccording to her, he never touched the kids, and she didn't think he ever would. What gave her that confidence, I don't know. \n\nHe granted her the divorce on the grounds she gave up custody, never contacted them again, never went public about what he did to her, and collaborated his story that he chose to divorce her due to her having a drinking problem and him not feeling safe with her around the kids. \n\nTo quote my grandmother as best as I can remember \n\n\"I thought about killing him and running away with them, stealing all the money I could from the house and starting over somewhere, but I knew I wouldn't get away with it, and my boys would end up living with his parents while I was thrown in jail. I had this mentality,  despite everything, that the boys deserved to have at least one of us around, so I agreed and left. My family knew the truth, but we never let it get out out of fear of him coming after us. I've had to make a lot of hard decisions in my life, but leaving my boys with him was the hardest thing I've ever done. I wish I could say I did it completely out of selflessness, that it was all for them, but there was always a part of me. A small, small part, that was just relieved I was free of him forever\". \n\nShe was so scared of him that when her sons contacted her  over sixty years later the first thing she asked was if their father was still alive. He had died a month prior to pancreatic cancer, they had spent the better part of a year looking for her after their step mother told them the truth. After learning everything from their father, who apparently became very truthful in his last days. they had no anger towards my grandmother for what she did. \n\nFor their father's part, he never abused them though he was very much a tough love parent with them while they were growing up which had already left them with a strained relationship prior to all this coming to light. They grew up very well off, both going to Ivy League schools. I know the one went into biomedical engineering I can't remember what the other did. \n\nThey would only meet my grandmother a few times before she herself passed away a year later due to a head injury from a fall. I only met them once and it was at the funeral. I haven't spoken to them since and neither has anybody else in the family as far as I know. Not due to hostility but simply due to us all having our own families and lives. \n\nI hope that helps clear any questions up.",
                "My father abandoned his wife of 6 years and 3 small children in 1964.  Literally went out for cigarettes and never came home.  The act completely wrecked the family: the kids were adopted out to other family members and the mom was never the same again.   \n\n2 years later in 1966 he met my mother, settled down under an assumed name, and had my sister in 1968 and me in 1973.  He took my birth certificate and created a new identity for himself (I never got a SS card until I was 12, and officially I am \"Junior\" even though my birth certificate says otherwise).  We found this out after his death in 2019, [when I found an envelope](https://imgur.com/t7LcmY3) addressed to me only, with 3 fake birth certificates, 3 sets of legit Social Security cards, 3 identities and a bunch of still-cryptic papers no one quite knows what to make of.  \n\nNo one knew.  We got in contact with our half siblings.  They are lovely people who have come to peace with the whole situation and are pretty well adjusted.  My sister and I are not and feel constant guilt over it.",

                "Some people will condemn her for not taking her kids, but this was a very different time for women's rights. \n\nShe was only 19 and married to an older man. There's no telling if she even wanted to be married much less a mother. Dude was physically abusive so it wouldn't be a stretch to think he was sexually abusive too and birth control wasn't really a thing back then. Divorce without cause was illegal at this time so she would have to legally prove he was abusive. Considering she wasn't having any luck getting help when she reported the abuse, it didn't seem likely. \n\nBack then women couldn't legally have their own bank account or credit card. Jobs for women didn't pay enough to really support a family. And until the 80s it was legal to refuse to rent to women with children. \n\nShe probably felt it was hopeless to even attempt to take her kids because she wouldn't be able to provide for them and he would be able to use them to keep control of her. She was young, abused, and desperate in a world where women were very restricted in what they could do. It's important to remember that.",

The family lore goes that he left on foot one night to pick up his paycheck and a freak rainstorm hit and he slipped on a riverbank and fell into swollen, raging waters.  My great great grandmother experienced tremendous financial hardship and mental health issues after he disappeared and the children were farmed out to various family members to raise.  \n\nI developed an interest in genealogy and putting together the family tree a few years ago.  It was chilling to find a census record, over 10 years after his alleged disappearance and death, of a man with his exact unique name (first, middle and last), birth date, country of origin and profession, married to a different woman who was not my GG grandmother, with small children, living just a couple of counties away from the small Iowa town that he had disappeared from.  I have no doubt that this man and my great great grandfather are the same person.  \n\nTo pull off such a stunt today would be unthinkable."

According to Islam, there is no such thing; one of the top Islamist leaders defined rape as consensual sex between unmarried men and women. \n\nLegalization of sex work. Yeah. \n\nEquity in inheritance laws. According to Islam, a daughter is entitled to exactly half the inheritance a son is entitled to. Equality is unacceptable to Islamists. \n\n\n\nWords can't express the fury and despair this evokes in sane Bangladeshis. Unlike us though, they are organized and motivated, and they currently have the upper hand. \n\nThese are very dark times, and it's only going to get worse, I'm afraid.",
