They are housed together in a single concrete cell with no natural light, fluorescent lights that are never turned off, no mats, no blankets, and limited bathroom facilities.\u201d\n\nCruel and unusual.",
                "\n#Canadian Woman Detained at US Border in Harrowing Ordeal\n\nA British Columbia woman has found herself trapped in a nightmare after being unexpectedly detained at the US border and transferred to an Arizona detention centre under conditions her family describes as inhumane.\n\nJasmine Mooney, a 35-year-old businesswoman from Abbotsford, was attempting to enter the United States through the San Ysidro border crossing between Mexico and San Diego on 3 March. She had hoped to apply for a Trade NAFTA (TN) work visa, but her paperwork was incomplete. Instead of being turned away or allowed to rectify the issue, she was arrested by US border officers and placed in detention.\n\nWhat followed has left her mother, Alexis Eagles, desperate for answers. After three nights at a San Diego detention centre, Mooney was handed over to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. For a brief moment, her family thought she had been released when an online tracking system marked her as free. Then she vanished.\n\nPanic set in when hours turned into a full day with no word from her. Eventually, the family learned that Mooney and around thirty others had been pulled from their cells in the middle of the night and transported to the San Luis Detention Center in Arizona. There, according to reports from inside, she has been crammed into a concrete cell with no natural light, harsh fluorescent bulbs that never switch off, no proper bedding and limited bathroom facilities.\n\nMooney has not been charged with any crime. She has no criminal record. She has simply been caught in a bureaucratic nightmare that has left her in chains, awaiting a resolution that remains unclear.\n\nHer mother is not disputing the right of US authorities to refuse Mooney entry. She does, however, take issue with the treatment her daughter is enduring. Mooney herself, in text messages to a business partner, described the conditions as \"inhumane.\" The women in detention are sleeping on mats, the food is barely edible, and the lights make proper rest impossible. Despite the circumstances, Mooney has tried to stay strong, telling her friend that she is in a better position than others and must keep going.\n\nMooney is no stranger to hard work. She built a career in Vancouver\u2019s hospitality industry after moving there from the Yukon in 2008, later expanding into the health and wellness sector. Her most recent work had her involved in Los Angeles, where she had previously been granted a TN work visa. That visa was revoked in November last year when she attempted to return to the US after a vacation. This time, hoping to secure another visa, she took the route that had worked for her before, crossing from Mexico. It was a decision that led to an ordeal beyond anything she could have imagined.\n\nHer business partner, BJ McCaslin, has been in touch with her through a prison communication app and is deeply concerned. He does not understand why she remains detained when there is no evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nGlobal Affairs Canada has acknowledged Mooney's detention and confirmed that consular officials are in contact with US authorities. Beyond that, they say little can be done. While governments may express concern, they rarely intervene when another country enforces its own immigration rules.\n\nThat leaves Mooney and her family in an agonising state of limbo. They are not asking for special treatment, only basic human decency. For now, all they can do is wait, and hope that her ordeal does not stretch on indefinitely.",

They already had the chance to deport her the \u201ctraditional\u201d way. They refused. They chose instead to retain her in this country and imprison her at taxpayer expense. \n\nTrump supporters, make it make sense. Why are your boys keeping them here instead of sending them home, if they are so scary and dangerous?"
