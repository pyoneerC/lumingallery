                "\"Parliament had made it clear strip searches were only supposed to be used \"in the most extreme of circumstances\", but that was not the way they were being executed by NSW Police.\"\n\nI know why, it's because you have perverts in positions of power and are abusing it for their own pleasure. \n\nShe was asked to strip, expose all parts of her body, drop her breasts, bend over and expose her anus and vagina, also ordering her to bend over while naked and remove a tampon. AND, a male police officer walked into the cubicle unannounced and observed the plaintiff in this position. Putting a woman through that because a cop had a \"hunch\"? Right. \n\nThose cops got off on it. Just disgusting behavior that should have consequences. This is not the kind of people you want in the police force.",
                "Police in Sydney routinely conduct invasive strip searches at music festivals. We\u2019re talking completely naked searches where guys are told to lift their balls, girls are told to lift their boobs, attendees are told to squat and cough, bend over etc. Most of these strip searches don\u2019t find any drugs, and you\u2019ve got reports of innocent people being left completely distraught after this has happened to them. NSW Police are currently facing a class action over this. So far around 3000 people have signed up. A trial for that class action began today, hence the article.\n\nFor background: In 2001, New South Wales (state in Australia, Sydney is the capital) introduced a law giving police the power to deploy drug detection dogs at certain public locations, namely at major events such as music festivals, train stations and at venues that serve alcohol, such as pubs and clubs. These dogs are notoriously unreliable, and there are reports on social media of handlers forcing their dogs to sit in front people in order to have them searched.\n\nMusic festivals are the worst. The police have drug detection dogs at every music festival in Sydney. At these events, they\u2019ll have a fenced off compound setup with makeshift structures such as tents or ticket booths where people stopped by the dogs are taken to be searched. Some people are lucky enough to get away with a pat down, but in many cases, festival attendees have been ordered to strip completely naked and bend over, squat etc. to have their bodies examined for drugs. At any given event, they\u2019ll strip search dozens of people like this. Total gestapo stuff and it\u2019s still happening today.",
                "Showing your butthole to security should not be a part of going to a festival. How the fuck did it get to that point where the people performing the searches think this is OK?",
                "People that put these policies in place should have to go through this stuff themselves in a public space and then decide if the \"problem\" they think they're solving is worth the solution they've decided upon.",

Below 'beyond a reasonable doubt'. \n\n>Court documents allege in March 2020, Stary had grabbed her then 9-year-old son by the back of his head, beat his face on the hardwood floor and carpet, then continued to beat his bruised face as his nose began to bleed. Stary was arrested and charged with injuring a child, a third-degree felony.\n\nShe was given a lifetime protective order against all her children. She now gets a new hearing with the new standard needing to be applied.",
                "You all would be shocked at how infrequently they went after parents who hurt their children. I would say it was less than 2%. \n\nI used to do this job. A solid third of my cases were bullshit weed and custody cases that no one cared about. There just weren't enough resources to care about this.\n\nAnother third was abject poverty and people living in falling apart plywood trailers with no plumbing or electricity in the middle of Texas summer. Obviously you can't have a newborn baby living in 110\u00b0 shed. Usually for that we would cram them in with the very unwilling family member and call it a day. There wasn't enough money to do anything else. \n\nA third of my cases were teen parents who didn't know any better and often didn't care but sometimes were trying. It's hard to be 15 and have a baby of your own when you're living on someone's couch. We usually got another unwilling family member to help supervise in these situations and called it a day. There wasn't enough money to do anything else. \n\nIn a perfect world I would have gotten them all affordable housing and healthcare and birth control and education and government IDs and bus passes and nutrition and clothes and sooooooo muchhhhhh therapyyyyyyy. \n\nA small portion of my cases were absolute monsters who needed to be locked up and so many of them escaped any sort of actual punishment. Again because of resources. \n\nVery frequently we terminated rights for shit parents but that's usually because the parents didn't even make an effort to complete the court required programs they were ordered to do. Simple stuff like parenting classes and showing up to visits and paying $10 a month in child support. Half the time they didn't even show up. I would tell them in person and in writing and tell the attorney \"hey this person has court on this date if they want to continue being a parent they need to show up.\" Nothing.\n\nParents who actually made even a half-assed effort got their kids back unless they were complete monsters like incest/rapists.",

Am I missing something?\n\n>Stary was arrested and charged with injuring a child, a third-degree felony.\n\nIf this woman beat her kid bloody, the should be convicted for that, which would require a higher burden of proof than terminating her parental rights.",

Protective orders usually require a very different showing and don't really emphasize the best interests of the child, like termination of parental rights.

There just weren't enough resources to care about this.\n\nAnother third was abject poverty and people living in falling apart plywood trailers with no plumbing or electricity in the middle of Texas summer. Obviously you can't have a newborn baby living in 110\u00b0 shed. Usually for that we would cram them in with the very unwilling family member and call it a day. There wasn't enough money to do anything else. \n\nA third of my cases were teen parents who didn't know any better and often didn't care but sometimes were trying. It's hard to be 15 and have a baby of your own when you're living on someone's couch. We usually got another unwilling family member to help supervise in these situations and called it a day. There wasn't enough money to do anything else. \n\nIn a perfect world I would have gotten them all affordable housing and healthcare and birth control and education and government IDs and bus passes and nutrition and clothes and sooooooo muchhhhhh therapyyyyyyy. \n\nA small portion of my cases were absolute monsters who needed to be locked up and so many of them escaped any sort of actual punishment. Again because of resources. \n\nVery frequently we terminated rights for shit parents but that's usually because the parents didn't even make an effort to complete the court required programs they were ordered to do. Simple stuff like parenting classes and showing up to visits and paying $10 a month in child support. Half the time they didn't even show up. I would tell them in person and in writing and tell the attorney \"hey this person has court on this date if they want to continue being a parent they need to show up.\" Nothing.\n\nParents who actually made even a half-assed effort got their kids back unless they were complete monsters like incest/rapists.",

Below 'beyond a reasonable doubt'. \n\n>Court documents allege in March 2020, Stary had grabbed her then 9-year-old son by the back of his head, beat his face on the hardwood floor and carpet, then continued to beat his bruised face as his nose began to bleed. Stary was arrested and charged with injuring a child, a third-degree felony.\n\nShe was given a lifetime protective order against all her children. She now gets a new hearing with the new standard needing to be applied.",
                "You all would be shocked at how infrequently they went after parents who hurt their children. I would say it was less than 2%. \n\nI used to do this job. A solid third of my cases were bullshit weed and custody cases that no one cared about. There just weren't enough resources to care about this.\n\nAnother third was abject poverty and people living in falling apart plywood trailers with no plumbing or electricity in the middle of Texas summer. Obviously you can't have a newborn baby living in 110\u00b0 shed. Usually for that we would cram them in with the very unwilling family member and call it a day. There wasn't enough money to do anything else. \n\nA third of my cases were teen parents who didn't know any better and often didn't care but sometimes were trying. It's hard to be 15 and have a baby of your own when you're living on someone's couch. We usually got another unwilling family member to help supervise in these situations and called it a day. There wasn't enough money to do anything else. \n\nIn a perfect world I would have gotten them all affordable housing and healthcare and birth control and education and government IDs and bus passes and nutrition and clothes and sooooooo muchhhhhh therapyyyyyyy. \n\nA small portion of my cases were absolute monsters who needed to be locked up and so many of them escaped any sort of actual punishment. Again because of resources. \n\nVery frequently we terminated rights for shit parents but that's usually because the parents didn't even make an effort to complete the court required programs they were ordered to do. Simple stuff like parenting classes and showing up to visits and paying $10 a month in child support. Half the time they didn't even show up. I would tell them in person and in writing and tell the attorney \"hey this person has court on this date if they want to continue being a parent they need to show up.\" Nothing.\n\nParents who actually made even a half-assed effort got their kids back unless they were complete monsters like incest/rapists.",

Protective orders usually require a very different showing and don't really emphasize the best interests of the child, like termination of parental rights.

                "\"Parliament had made it clear strip searches were only supposed to be used \"in the most extreme of circumstances\", but that was not the way they were being executed by NSW Police.\"\n\nI know why, it's because you have perverts in positions of power and are abusing it for their own pleasure. \n\nShe was asked to strip, expose all parts of her body, drop her breasts, bend over and expose her anus and vagina, also ordering her to bend over while naked and remove a tampon. AND, a male police officer walked into the cubicle unannounced and observed the plaintiff in this position. Putting a woman through that because a cop had a \"hunch\"? Right. \n\nThose cops got off on it. Just disgusting behavior that should have consequences. This is not the kind of people you want in the police force.",
                "Police in Sydney routinely conduct invasive strip searches at music festivals. We\u2019re talking completely naked searches where guys are told to lift their balls, girls are told to lift their boobs, attendees are told to squat and cough, bend over etc. Most of these strip searches don\u2019t find any drugs, and you\u2019ve got reports of innocent people being left completely distraught after this has happened to them. NSW Police are currently facing a class action over this. So far around 3000 people have signed up. A trial for that class action began today, hence the article.\n\nFor background: In 2001, New South Wales (state in Australia, Sydney is the capital) introduced a law giving police the power to deploy drug detection dogs at certain public locations, namely at major events such as music festivals, train stations and at venues that serve alcohol, such as pubs and clubs. These dogs are notoriously unreliable, and there are reports on social media of handlers forcing their dogs to sit in front people in order to have them searched.\n\nMusic festivals are the worst. The police have drug detection dogs at every music festival in Sydney. At these events, they\u2019ll have a fenced off compound setup with makeshift structures such as tents or ticket booths where people stopped by the dogs are taken to be searched. Some people are lucky enough to get away with a pat down, but in many cases, festival attendees have been ordered to strip completely naked and bend over, squat etc. to have their bodies examined for drugs. At any given event, they\u2019ll strip search dozens of people like this. Total gestapo stuff and it\u2019s still happening today.",
