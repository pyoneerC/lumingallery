Slavery \"officially\" ended in America in 1865, but it continued for decades thanks to loopholes in the form of predatory contracts. African Americans who had been kept illiterate by slavery were tricked into signing contracts with their former masters in which they were sold land in exchange for a percentage of their crops. The contracts were routinely altered, however, to make it impossible to actually pay off that land, creating a cycle of permanent debt slavery. It wasn't until reformers from the North started opening Black schools, and the people became educated, that African Americans were able to read and understand the contracts they were signing, seek legal counsel, find representation in Washington, etc. In other words, slavery doesn't end with an amendment. It ends with education.",
