                "Absolutely nuts \n\n> NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A Brooklyn woman said she feared for her life as she was chased, kicked, spit at and pelted with objects by a mob of Orthodox Jewish men who mistook her as a participant in a protest against Israel\u2019s far-right security minister.\n\n-\n\n> The woman, a neighborhood resident in her 30s, told The Associated Press she learned of the protest after hearing police helicopters over her apartment. She walked over to investigate around 10:30 p.m. but by then the protest had mostly disbursed. Not wanting to be filmed, she covered her face with a scarf.\n\n>\u201cAs soon as I pulled up my scarf, a group of 100 men came over immediately and encircled me,\u201d said the woman, who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity because she feared for her safety.\n\n>\u2018I had nowhere to go\u2019\n\n>\u201cThey were shouting at me, threatening to rape me, chanting \u2018death to Arabs.\u2019 I thought the police would protect me from the mob, but they did nothing to intervene,\u201d she said.\n\n>As the chants grew in intensity, a lone police officer tried to escort her to safety. They were followed for blocks by hundreds of men and boys jeering in Hebrew and English.\n\n>Video shows two of the men kicking her in the back, another hurling a traffic cone into her head and a fourth pushing a trash can into her.\n\n>\u201cThis is America,\u201d one of the men can be heard saying. \u201cWe got Israel. We got an Army now.\u201d\n\n>At one point, she and the police officer were nearly cornered against a building, the video shows.\n\n>\u201cI felt sheer terror,\u201d the woman recalled. \u201cI realized at that point that I couldn\u2019t lead this mob of men to my home. I had nowhere to go. I didn\u2019t know what to do. I was just terrified.\u201d",

She walked over to investigate around 10:30 p.m. but by then the protest had mostly disbursed. Not wanting to be filmed, she covered her face with a scarf.\n\n>\u201cAs soon as I pulled up my scarf, a group of 100 men came over immediately and encircled me,\u201d said the woman, who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity because she feared for her safety.\n\n>\u2018I had nowhere to go\u2019\n\n>\u201cThey were shouting at me, threatening to rape me, chanting \u2018death to Arabs.\u2019 I thought the police would protect me from the mob, but they did nothing to intervene,\u201d she said.\n\n>As the chants grew in intensity, a lone police officer tried to escort her to safety. They were followed for blocks by hundreds of men and boys jeering in Hebrew and English.\n\n>Video shows two of the men kicking her in the back, another hurling a traffic cone into her head and a fourth pushing a trash can into her.\n\n>\u201cThis is America,\u201d one of the men can be heard saying. \u201cWe got Israel. We got an Army now.\u201d\n\n>At one point, she and the police officer were nearly cornered against a building, the video shows.\n\n>\u201cI felt sheer terror,\u201d the woman recalled. \u201cI realized at that point that I couldn\u2019t lead this mob of men to my home.

She walked over to investigate around 10:30 p.m. but by then the protest had mostly disbursed. Not wanting to be filmed, she covered her face with a scarf.\n\n>\u201cAs soon as I pulled up my scarf, a group of 100 men came over immediately and encircled me,\u201d said the woman, who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity because she feared for her safety.\n\n>\u2018I had nowhere to go\u2019\n\n>\u201cThey were shouting at me, threatening to rape me, chanting \u2018death to Arabs.\u2019 I thought the police would protect me from the mob, but they did nothing to intervene,\u201d she said.\n\n>As the chants grew in intensity, a lone police officer tried to escort her to safety. They were followed for blocks by hundreds of men and boys jeering in Hebrew and English.\n\n>Video shows two of the men kicking her in the back, another hurling a traffic cone into her head and a fourth pushing a trash can into her.\n\n>\u201cThis is America,\u201d one of the men can be heard saying. \u201cWe got Israel. We got an Army now.\u201d\n\n>At one point, she and the police officer were nearly cornered against a building, the video shows.\n\n>\u201cI felt sheer terror,\u201d the woman recalled. \u201cI realized at that point that I couldn\u2019t lead this mob of men to my home. I had nowhere to go. I didn\u2019t know what to do. I was just terrified.\u201d",
