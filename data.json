(There's a summer camp there that predates the smokestacks that kids roll around in the dirt right THERE.) \n\nIn Butte, Montana and subsequently a 200 mile radius and anywhere in the MT/WY/NV area there are both smokestack areas of contamination and pools of deadly chemicals leftover from the 1800s-1970s. Pools of arsenic and lead. If you've been there you know.  Cows and horses just walk around grazing in these areas.\n\nPicher, Oklahoma - \"the most toxic ghost town\" in the USA.

I went to a museum exhibit on it in Norman.\n\nEdmond, OK - currently having to treat it's watershed contaminated with fracking juices - oh but they won't tell you that.  They just want to see you bougie houses and ride out the earthquakes.  (source - Geologist who works for oil company who quit over it I dated - so dubious.) \n\nQuestion is not \"We make money now\"\n\nbut \"Where will we live AFTER the mine closes and we don't make money anymore?\"\n\nExample of Lithium Extract- from source:\n\n# Brine Extraction\n\nBrine extraction is another method of extracting lithium. This method involves pumping brine from underground aquifers into evaporation ponds. The sun and wind evaporate the water, leaving behind lithium and other minerals. The following are the steps involved in brine extraction:\n\n* Drilling: Wells are drilled into the ground to access the brine.\n* Pumping: The brine is pumped to the surface and transported to the evaporation ponds.\n* Evaporation: The brine is evaporated in the ponds, leaving behind lithium and other minerals.\n* Processing: The extracted lithium is then processed to produce lithium carbonate or other lithium compounds.\n\nBrine extraction is a less costly and less energy-intensive method of extracting lithium. It is also less harmful to the environment than hard rock mining. However, it is highly dependent on weather conditions, and the process can take several months to complete.\n\nOverall, both hard rock mining and brine extraction have their advantages and disadvantages. Companies choose the method that suits their needs and resources.\n\n#",
                "For those unaware, the U.S. has lithium in a ton of places but as of now the only real site that is extracting lithium in any meaningful capacity is in Nevada. There is a site that has been identified for development in Arizona as well.\n\nBut all of that is sort of moot because right now virtually all REFINING of lithium has to go through China so absent developing that domestic refining we won\u2019t be gaining independence any time soon.",

The fine was then doubled \u201cpursuant to an escalating penalty structure for repeat riding crop violations within the previous 180 days,\u201d resulting in a $62,000 fine, according to HISA.\n\nAlvarado was found to have struck Sovereignty eight times during the Kentucky Derby, which was his second offense in 180 days, per a HISA ruling. HISA protocol allows jockeys to strike horses a maximum of six times during a race.\n\nThe jockey was also suspended for two Kentucky racing days, May 29 and 30, as a result of the violation.\n\nThe jockey and Sovereignty won the 151st running of the Kentucky Derby last Saturday at Churchill Downs.",

You can whip the shit out of yourself and it isn't particularly painful, even on bare skin and in sensitive areas. The sound and the sensation are absolutely used to continue encouraging the horse to move forward. The limit was put into place to prevent an obscene amount of strikes going down the stretch. It is absolutely possible to lose track with the adrenaline of everything, especially once a jockey and horse fall into rhythm. The only type of legal whip used in US racing now is usually fiberglass wrapped in thick foam. It is designed to cause a loud sound more than cause pain.\n\n> For the record, jockeys won't make millions riding one race: they take home roughly 10% of the earnings. Jose Alvarado took home $310,000 for his effort; he acknowledges his mistake, he understands he was one strike over, and he will pay his $31,000 fine.\nUnsure if links are allowed, but this is a pretty fair assessment of the use of whips in racing.\n\n> https://lightupracing.com/why-are-whips-used-in-racing/",

His detention began in March 2025, despite the U.S. government later dropping one of the charges against him. \n\nDoroudi's student visa was revoked in June 2023 without explanation.  At that time, the university advised him that he could legally remain in the U.S. as long as he maintained his student status and did not leave the country.  In the spring of 2025, the government filed two charges to justify his deportation: the revoked visa and his alleged failure to maintain student status.  The first charge was withdrawn after the government acknowledged that the visa revocation was \"prudential\" and not immediately effective.  His attorney, David Rozas, is contesting the second charge. \n\nDespite having no criminal record or involvement in political activism, Doroudi was denied bond and held in a Louisiana detention facility.  Frustrated by the prolonged detention and the impact on his life, he chose to self-deport.  His fianc\u00e9e, Sama Ebrahimi Bajgani, and his attorney expressed deep sadness and questioned why he was targeted.

The fine was then doubled \u201cpursuant to an escalating penalty structure for repeat riding crop violations within the previous 180 days,\u201d resulting in a $62,000 fine, according to HISA.\n\nAlvarado was found to have struck Sovereignty eight times during the Kentucky Derby, which was his second offense in 180 days, per a HISA ruling. HISA protocol allows jockeys to strike horses a maximum of six times during a race.\n\nThe jockey was also suspended for two Kentucky racing days, May 29 and 30, as a result of the violation.\n\nThe jockey and Sovereignty won the 151st running of the Kentucky Derby last Saturday at Churchill Downs.",

You can whip the shit out of yourself and it isn't particularly painful, even on bare skin and in sensitive areas. The sound and the sensation are absolutely used to continue encouraging the horse to move forward. The limit was put into place to prevent an obscene amount of strikes going down the stretch. It is absolutely possible to lose track with the adrenaline of everything, especially once a jockey and horse fall into rhythm. The only type of legal whip used in US racing now is usually fiberglass wrapped in thick foam. It is designed to cause a loud sound more than cause pain.\n\n> For the record, jockeys won't make millions riding one race: they take home roughly 10% of the earnings. Jose Alvarado took home $310,000 for his effort; he acknowledges his mistake, he understands he was one strike over, and he will pay his $31,000 fine.\nUnsure if links are allowed, but this is a pretty fair assessment of the use of whips in racing.\n\n> https://lightupracing.com/why-are-whips-used-in-racing/",

                "Alireza Doroudi, a 32-year-old Iranian doctoral student in mechanical engineering at the University of Alabama, has decided to voluntarily leave the United States after being detained for six weeks by immigration authorities.  His detention began in March 2025, despite the U.S. government later dropping one of the charges against him. \n\nDoroudi's student visa was revoked in June 2023 without explanation.  At that time, the university advised him that he could legally remain in the U.S. as long as he maintained his student status and did not leave the country.  In the spring of 2025, the government filed two charges to justify his deportation: the revoked visa and his alleged failure to maintain student status.  The first charge was withdrawn after the government acknowledged that the visa revocation was \"prudential\" and not immediately effective.  His attorney, David Rozas, is contesting the second charge. \n\nDespite having no criminal record or involvement in political activism, Doroudi was denied bond and held in a Louisiana detention facility.  Frustrated by the prolonged detention and the impact on his life, he chose to self-deport.  His fianc\u00e9e, Sama Ebrahimi Bajgani, and his attorney expressed deep sadness and questioned why he was targeted.  Doroudi's case has heightened fear among international students in Alabama, particularly within the Iranian community, amid a broader immigration crackdown under President Trump's administration.",

The fine was then doubled \u201cpursuant to an escalating penalty structure for repeat riding crop violations within the previous 180 days,\u201d resulting in a $62,000 fine, according to HISA.\n\nAlvarado was found to have struck Sovereignty eight times during the Kentucky Derby, which was his second offense in 180 days, per a HISA ruling. HISA protocol allows jockeys to strike horses a maximum of six times during a race.\n\nThe jockey was also suspended for two Kentucky racing days, May 29 and 30, as a result of the violation.\n\nThe jockey and Sovereignty won the 151st running of the Kentucky Derby last Saturday at Churchill Downs.",

You can whip the shit out of yourself and it isn't particularly painful, even on bare skin and in sensitive areas. The sound and the sensation are absolutely used to continue encouraging the horse to move forward. The limit was put into place to prevent an obscene amount of strikes going down the stretch. It is absolutely possible to lose track with the adrenaline of everything, especially once a jockey and horse fall into rhythm. The only type of legal whip used in US racing now is usually fiberglass wrapped in thick foam. It is designed to cause a loud sound more than cause pain.\n\n> For the record, jockeys won't make millions riding one race: they take home roughly 10% of the earnings. Jose Alvarado took home $310,000 for his effort; he acknowledges his mistake, he understands he was one strike over, and he will pay his $31,000 fine.\nUnsure if links are allowed, but this is a pretty fair assessment of the use of whips in racing.\n\n> https://lightupracing.com/why-are-whips-used-in-racing/",

                "Alireza Doroudi, a 32-year-old Iranian doctoral student in mechanical engineering at the University of Alabama, has decided to voluntarily leave the United States after being detained for six weeks by immigration authorities.  His detention began in March 2025, despite the U.S. government later dropping one of the charges against him. \n\nDoroudi's student visa was revoked in June 2023 without explanation.  At that time, the university advised him that he could legally remain in the U.S. as long as he maintained his student status and did not leave the country.  In the spring of 2025, the government filed two charges to justify his deportation: the revoked visa and his alleged failure to maintain student status.  The first charge was withdrawn after the government acknowledged that the visa revocation was \"prudential\" and not immediately effective.  His attorney, David Rozas, is contesting the second charge. \n\nDespite having no criminal record or involvement in political activism, Doroudi was denied bond and held in a Louisiana detention facility.  Frustrated by the prolonged detention and the impact on his life, he chose to self-deport.  His fianc\u00e9e, Sama Ebrahimi Bajgani, and his attorney expressed deep sadness and questioned why he was targeted.  Doroudi's case has heightened fear among international students in Alabama, particularly within the Iranian community, amid a broader immigration crackdown under President Trump's administration.",

The US does have some other processing capabilities, but its mostly the Aussies with the know-how (I guess it involves using shitty beer to do it? j/k). \n\nBear in mind that if its processed abroad thats 2 x shipping costs, plus hazards materials handling, plus a tariff.\n\nSo that $1.8Bln plant, even if its a smaller facility, will be really useful!

(There's a summer camp there that predates the smokestacks that kids roll around in the dirt right THERE.) \n\nIn Butte, Montana and subsequently a 200 mile radius and anywhere in the MT/WY/NV area there are both smokestack areas of contamination and pools of deadly chemicals leftover from the 1800s-1970s. Pools of arsenic and lead. If you've been there you know.  Cows and horses just walk around grazing in these areas.\n\nPicher, Oklahoma - \"the most toxic ghost town\" in the USA.

They just want to see you bougie houses and ride out the earthquakes.  (source - Geologist who works for oil company who quit over it I dated - so dubious.) \n\nQuestion is not \"We make money now\"\n\nbut \"Where will we live AFTER the mine closes and we don't make money anymore?\"\n\nExample of Lithium Extract- from source:\n\n# Brine Extraction\n\nBrine extraction is another method of extracting lithium. This method involves pumping brine from underground aquifers into evaporation ponds. The sun and wind evaporate the water, leaving behind lithium and other minerals. The following are the steps involved in brine extraction:\n\n* Drilling: Wells are drilled into the ground to access the brine.\n* Pumping: The brine is pumped to the surface and transported to the evaporation ponds.\n* Evaporation: The brine is evaporated in the ponds, leaving behind lithium and other minerals.\n* Processing: The extracted lithium is then processed to produce lithium carbonate or other lithium compounds.\n\nBrine extraction is a less costly and less energy-intensive method of extracting lithium. It is also less harmful to the environment than hard rock mining. However, it is highly dependent on weather conditions, and the process can take several months to complete.\n\nOverall, both hard rock mining and brine extraction have their advantages and disadvantages. Companies choose the method that suits their needs and resources.\n\n#",
                "For those unaware, the U.S. has lithium in a ton of places but as of now the only real site that is extracting lithium in any meaningful capacity is in Nevada. There is a site that has been identified for development in Arizona as well.\n\nBut all of that is sort of moot because right now virtually all REFINING of lithium has to go through China so absent developing that domestic refining we won\u2019t be gaining independence any time soon.",
