                "They signed a contract, used the services, and then lied to their credit card company that the charges were fraudulent to get them removed, then went on social media to brag about how they beat the timeshare company.\n\nI'm glad they aren't in prison, but I hope they will be paying back what they owe.",
                "I really doubt that Mexican prison timeshares will become very popular.",
                "I went deep in the rabbit hole on this one to find out what was going on. The timeshare was more like a hotel status you bought that gave you a ton of perks such as large discounts on booking at these resorts. One of the perks was unlimited \u201creferrals\u201d so you could have friends book and get your rate. If you traveled at the same time as your referral the referral would get the elevated status while they stayed at the resort. The couple would get free nights and free flights because of this. \n\nThey were part of Facebook group(s) to sell these referrals. Supposedly they were going down more than once per month. The lady didn\u2019t work and treated it almost like a job. Finally the resort stopped the unlimited referrals and threaten to cancel their upcoming stays (they booked a bachelor party for their son or something) if they didn\u2019t sign a document.\n\nLady got mad and got AMEX to cancel the charges. She then went to those Facebook groups and told others how to do it. She also pretty much said that they will try to bug you for a while but if you ignore them enough the resort will just go away.\n\nWhat kind of blows my mind is the fact they decided to come back to Cancun thinking Mexico wouldn\u2019t care.",

                "What Americans must realize is that American laws ended on American borders. Maybe in America it is fine to gloat about your victories against the timeshare company, but it won\u2019t be so in other countries. Maybe in America it\u2019s not common to jail people over civil matters but not in other country.\n\nWe have learned how Americans carried drugs to Russia. Or handguns to Japan. We must really understand that when we step into other country THEIR laws apply and there is nothing you can do to change that. \n\nSo the prisons are like a \u201chell-hole\u201d? Then DO NOT cause problems on other country!",

A disproportionate share of poor folks and charity care. A national marketplace for trained healthcare staff, supplies and pharmaceuticals. It will be too much to shift to other sources. Hope folks like driving 2-3 hours for healthcare. Ambulance service will be iffy. There will be unnecessary deaths from both age and accidents.  Not to say the system we have now is the greatest,  but cutting without a real , thoughtful plan will destroy things that will be very difficult to put back together.",
