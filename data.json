                "Police in Sydney routinely conduct invasive strip searches at music festivals. These are completely naked searches where guys are told to lift their balls, girls are told to lift their boobs, attendees are told to squat and cough, bend over etc. Most of these strip searches don\u2019t find any drugs, and you\u2019ve got reports of innocent people being left completely distraught after this has happened to them. NSW Police are currently facing a class action over this. So far around 3000 people have signed up. A trial for that class action began last week. \n\nFor background: In 2001, New South Wales (state in Australia, Sydney is the capital) introduced a law giving police the power to deploy drug detection dogs at certain public locations, namely at major events such as music festivals, train stations and at venues that serve alcohol, such as pubs and clubs. These dogs are notoriously unreliable, and there are reports on social media of handlers forcing their dogs to sit in front people in order to have them searched.\n\nIt's just crazy. You can turn up to a train station in Sydney and there\u2019ll be a dozen officers standing around watching while a dog is sniffing commuters. Same deal at pubs. You can be having a beer and all of a sudden the police will burst in and block off all the exits so a dog can be brought round to sniff everyone. They used to do this every weekend picking clubs and pubs at random. \n\nMusic festivals are the worst. The police have drug detection dogs at every music festival in Sydney. At these events, they\u2019ll have a fenced off compound setup with makeshift structures such as tents or ticket booths where people stopped by the dogs are taken to be searched. Some people are lucky enough to get away with a pat down, but in many cases, festival attendees have been ordered to strip completely naked and bend over, squat etc. to have their bodies examined for drugs. At any given event, they\u2019ll strip search dozens of people like this. Total gestapo stuff and it\u2019s still happening today.",

The prison\u2019s investigative unit and the Kern County District Attorney\u2019s Office are investigating, he said.\n\n>In December 2022, [a Los Angeles jury found Lanez guilty of three charges](https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/08/entertainment/tory-lanez-sentence-megan-thee-stallion) related to the July 2020 shooting of fellow rapper Megan Thee Stallion whose legal name is Megan Pete.\n\n>She testified during the trial that she and Lanez had left a party at Kylie Jenner\u2019s Hollywood Hills home in July 2020 when Lanez fired a gun at the back of her feet and ordered her to dance. She said the shooting occurred after they argued and she exited the SUV in which they had been traveling.\n\n>\u201cEvery day I think of others across the world who are victims of violence and survive. It is truly the most powerless feeling, especially when you question whether the justice system can truly protect you,\u201d she said in a statement which LA County District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n read at a press conference following Lanez\u2019s conviction. \u201cFortunately, the district attorney\u2019s office fought for me. I\u2019m incredibly grateful to them and the jury for the attention to the evidence and siding with the truth. But if it can happen to me, imagine those who lack the resources and support systems to help them.\u201d\n\n>Lanez has insisted on his innocence and his lawyers appealed his conviction. In May 2023 a judge denied a motion for him to receive a new trial. The star\u2019s legal team had argued that some of the evidence presented had wrongly been admitted into the trial.",

                "Police in Sydney routinely conduct invasive strip searches at music festivals. These are completely naked searches where guys are told to lift their balls, girls are told to lift their boobs, attendees are told to squat and cough, bend over etc. Most of these strip searches don\u2019t find any drugs, and you\u2019ve got reports of innocent people being left completely distraught after this has happened to them. NSW Police are currently facing a class action over this. So far around 3000 people have signed up. A trial for that class action began last week. \n\nFor background: In 2001, New South Wales (state in Australia, Sydney is the capital) introduced a law giving police the power to deploy drug detection dogs at certain public locations, namely at major events such as music festivals, train stations and at venues that serve alcohol, such as pubs and clubs. These dogs are notoriously unreliable, and there are reports on social media of handlers forcing their dogs to sit in front people in order to have them searched.\n\nIt's just crazy. You can turn up to a train station in Sydney and there\u2019ll be a dozen officers standing around watching while a dog is sniffing commuters. Same deal at pubs. You can be having a beer and all of a sudden the police will burst in and block off all the exits so a dog can be brought round to sniff everyone. They used to do this every weekend picking clubs and pubs at random. \n\nMusic festivals are the worst. The police have drug detection dogs at every music festival in Sydney. At these events, they\u2019ll have a fenced off compound setup with makeshift structures such as tents or ticket booths where people stopped by the dogs are taken to be searched. Some people are lucky enough to get away with a pat down, but in many cases, festival attendees have been ordered to strip completely naked and bend over, squat etc. to have their bodies examined for drugs. At any given event, they\u2019ll strip search dozens of people like this. Total gestapo stuff and it\u2019s still happening today.",
                "How are Australians ok with something like this? People do tons of drugs at American music festivals and we seem to be doing fine.",
                "Being strip searched is a major violation. It's insane that you can just be an ordinary person doing nothing wrong and police can make you strip based on the an alert from a dog that they know is usually wrong. And for what? They're usually not even looking for major drug operations. Just people with drugs, probably mostly for their own personal use. I'm way more concerned about sex crimes than drug use, and in this case, the police are committing them. Or they would be, if the law didn't give them a special exception.",
                "If the people are going to put up with being strip searched like they're actual felons than unfortunately, it's going to keep continuing. This means both in the people you elect, and the actions you do. For many boycotting/protesting the venues that do this matters far less than seeing the big show done by a band they've made a huge part of their own self-identity.\n\nOf course this politics and involves the government, but if people stop showing up to the biggest venues in the city in protest to this, the venue owners will go to local politicians and push serious money to get it changed.\n\nEverything is politics, even music festivals, and your own attendance to them.",
                "I lived in Sydney 20 years ago and it was frightening how the police behaved. Sitting in a pub in the afternoon and having a gang of armed police in militaristic uniforms go from table to table with an alsatian sniffing everybody while the cops glare at you like they're trying their best to catch you out or bait you into challenging them so they can beat you down... it's grim, man.

It is truly the most powerless feeling, especially when you question whether the justice system can truly protect you,\u201d she said in a statement which LA County District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n read at a press conference following Lanez\u2019s conviction. \u201cFortunately, the district attorney\u2019s office fought for me. I\u2019m incredibly grateful to them and the jury for the attention to the evidence and siding with the truth. But if it can happen to me, imagine those who lack the resources and support systems to help them.\u201d\n\n>Lanez has insisted on his innocence and his lawyers appealed his conviction. In May 2023 a judge denied a motion for him to receive a new trial. The star\u2019s legal team had argued that some of the evidence presented had wrongly been admitted into the trial.",
