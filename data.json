This purge impresses a stain on the honor of our Armed Forces that will never be expunged. I would expect them to be slow-walking every step. Every order should be met by the impenetrable bureaucracy and red tape that military organizations are famous for. Every signature should be obtained only after each word of the orders and plans are inspected in detail, reviewed by committees, stamped, filed, lost, found, encoded with reference numbers, and distributed to each relevant department. If a form must be filled out, pens should be requisitioned for the purpose. When the pens arrive, they should be deemed unsuitable because the ink viscosity doesn't comply with procurement regulations. The rejected shipment should be returned, and a refund from the contracted vendor obtained and accounted before a new requisition is originated. And once pens are obtained, the forms can be filled out in proper triplicate, to be separated and filed in their widespread destinations. \n\nUn-American orders need not be expedited; they should be completed with \"all deliberate speed\". Emphasis on \"deliberation\". If the \"Received\" stamp is crooked in its little square, the paperwork should be rejected without explanation until a communication is established to convey that the papers need to be re-done, with a proper cross-reference number linking the rejected paperwork with the replacement.\n\nRemoving an entry on a website *ought to take MONTHS.*",

                "#Tragic Toll: Four Harris County Officers Take Their Own Lives in Just Six Weeks\n\nQuiet grief has settled over Harris County as the community reels from the shocking loss of four current and former deputies, each taking their own life in the space of just six weeks. The most recent was Deputy Christina Kohler, a well-respected veteran whose death last week was officially ruled a suicide. She was just 37.\n\nKohler had been reported missing, sparking concern across the force. A public alert was issued and the search began. Days later, on 13 March, her body was found. The news stunned friends and colleagues. Just three days after Kohler's death, former deputy Maria Vasquez, who left the sheriff's office in December, also died by apparent suicide. Then, earlier this week, another former deputy, William Bozeman, was found dead. The pattern is as heartbreaking as it is alarming.\n\n\u201cIt caught a lot of us by surprise,\u201d said Jose Lopez, president of the Harris County Deputies' Organisation. \u201cOne is too many. Two? Three? Yes, it's devastating.\u201d\n\nLopez, who had known two of the fallen deputies for over twenty years, has been helping colleagues come to terms with the grief. He\u2019s also grappling with the death of former deputy Long Nguyen, who took his own life in early February at the age of 58. For Lopez, the pain is personal. For the department, it\u2019s a wake-up call.\n\nThere is growing concern about the toll this profession takes on those who serve. Policing is a job that deals daily with trauma, danger and confrontation. It can grind away at a person\u2019s mental health until there is very little left to give. Dr Thomas McNeese, who heads up the Sheriff's Office Behavioural Health Division, is all too aware of the emotional weight deputies carry. His team offers peer-to-peer support and has been working since 2020 to provide help, but even he admits the past few weeks have been especially hard.\n\n\u201cThis profession takes a toll,\u201d said McNeese. \u201cThe longer you're in it, the more it changes you.\u201d\n\nLaw enforcement officers have long been known to suffer disproportionately from mental health issues and suicide. The nature of the work, the things they witness, the pressure to remain composed in the face of chaos, it all builds up. McNeese is urging those who are struggling to reach out, to talk, to act.\n\n\u201cGetting help, doing something to not stay stuck, that\u2019s important,\u201d he said.\n\nInside the department, questions are being asked. Despite the resources already in place, Lopez wonders if it is enough. Is there more they could be doing? Is something being missed?\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t help but ask,\u201d he said. \u201cDo we need to take a different approach?\u201d",
                "I want to say someone is covering their tracks, the guilty are taking the easy way out before the hammer falls or a little bit of both.\n\nOn the other hand, suicide is often contagious.",

                "#Tear Gas and Turmoil as Turkey Rises for Justice\n\nThe streets of Istanbul have been lit up not by celebration but by the fierce glow of protest as thousands rally for justice following the arrest of the city\u2019s mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu. For four nights running, crowds have surged across Turkey\u2019s major cities, marking the country\u2019s largest wave of demonstrations in over a decade. What began with a few scattered gatherings has now grown into a roar of resistance.\n\nImamoglu, long seen as a serious rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, was taken into custody on Wednesday, just days before his party was expected to confirm him as their presidential candidate for 2028. Accused of corruption and aiding terrorist groups, charges he flatly denies, his arrest has shaken the political landscape and drawn thousands into the streets demanding his release.\n\nOn Saturday, he appeared in court, his supporters chanting \"rights, law, justice\" outside as tear gas swirled in the cold night air. Riot police stood shoulder to shoulder, firing round after round to break up the crowds, but still they came. Mothers holding their children, students in masks, pensioners waving flags, all united by a shared belief that something fundamental is slipping away.\n\n\"I'm here for liberty,\" one young woman told the BBC, her face hidden behind a mask. \"Turkish people cannot accept this. This is against our behaviour and culture.\" Her words echoed the mood across Istanbul, where the government has banned public gatherings in a bid to quell the unrest. But the ban only seems to have poured fuel on the fire.\n\nIn Izmir and Ankara, the story was much the same. Water cannons, arrests, more tear gas. On Friday alone, 343 people were reportedly detained. Still, the crowds held their ground, shouting not in anger but in defiance, determined to be heard. There is an unmistakable feeling that this is no longer just about one man, but about the future of democracy itself in Turkey.\n\nImamoglu\u2019s bid for the presidency now hangs in the balance. Just a day before his arrest, Istanbul University stripped him of his degree, citing irregularities. If upheld, this would disqualify him from running, as Turkish law requires a university qualification for presidential candidates. The timing has raised eyebrows across the political spectrum.\n\nPresident Erdogan, who has ruled the country for over two decades, cannot stand again in 2028 unless the constitution is changed. Critics argue that the arrests of Imamoglu and more than a hundred others, including journalists and business figures, are an attempt to clear the political field before the next election. The government, for its part, insists the judiciary is acting independently and has hit out at those suggesting otherwise.\n\nWhether or not that claim holds weight, what is clear is that a growing number of Turkish citizens feel they are being silenced. The sheer courage of those risking arrest to march night after night speaks volumes. These protests are no longer just about one politician behind bars. They are about the soul of a nation, and the kind of future its people are willing to fight for."

This purge impresses a stain on the honor of our Armed Forces that will never be expunged. I would expect them to be slow-walking every step. Every order should be met by the impenetrable bureaucracy and red tape that military organizations are famous for. Every signature should be obtained only after each word of the orders and plans are inspected in detail, reviewed by committees, stamped, filed, lost, found, encoded with reference numbers, and distributed to each relevant department.

When the pens arrive, they should be deemed unsuitable because the ink viscosity doesn't comply with procurement regulations. The rejected shipment should be returned, and a refund from the contracted vendor obtained and accounted before a new requisition is originated. And once pens are obtained, the forms can be filled out in proper triplicate, to be separated and filed in their widespread destinations. \n\nUn-American orders need not be expedited; they should be completed with \"all deliberate speed\".

If a form must be filled out, pens should be requisitioned for the purpose. When the pens arrive, they should be deemed unsuitable because the ink viscosity doesn't comply with procurement regulations. The rejected shipment should be returned, and a refund from the contracted vendor obtained and accounted before a new requisition is originated. And once pens are obtained, the forms can be filled out in proper triplicate, to be separated and filed in their widespread destinations. \n\nUn-American orders need not be expedited; they should be completed with \"all deliberate speed\". Emphasis on \"deliberation\".

                "From The CBC:\n\n>The Ottawa-Carleton District School Board (OCDSB) is locked in a court battle to compel social media site Reddit to turn over identifying information of a user who it alleges has been defaming staff at a local elementary school.\n\n>The board alleges the posts about ongoing issues at Pinecrest Public School were made in an attempt to defame employees \u201cfor some unknown ulterior motive.\u201d None of the allegations have been proven in court.\n\n>The board wants Reddit to provide any email addresses, phone numbers, location data and other identifying information about the user. In a statement, it said it was compelled by its \u201cunwavering dedication to creating a positive and supportive environment for all members of the OCDSB community.\u201d\n\n>Reddit argues handing over the information will create a chill among other users, explaining in its court filings that \u201canonymity is not just a user preference but a defining feature of Reddit\u2019s business model and identity.\u201d\n\n>Most of the comments in question were in response to discussions around news stories about the board and problems at specific schools. Several involved specific incidents and ongoing issues at Pinecrest Public School that have been reported in the media.\n\n>Some of the comments singled out the school\u2019s principal and a superintendent, the board said in its court filings. Reddit\u2019s court filings mention 51 comments by the user in 17 different conversations. \n\n>User alleged OCDSB failed to report violence, racism. According to the OCDSB, the \u201cfalse and defamatory\u201d comments began on Dec. 17, 2022. Naming individual staff members, the user accused them of failing to report incidents, stifling investigations and ignoring instances of racism.\n\n>According to the board, the comments were dishonest, disrespectful and created a toxic work environment. The anonymous user also insinuated that staff members had \u201cacquiesced in the perpetration of racist acts at the school,\u201d the board said.\n\n>During a lengthy Reddit thread about a high school [student who died after being stabbed in Nepean](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/high-school-student-stabbed-last-week-in-nepean-dies-1.7194798) last May, the user accused an OCDSB superintendent of ignoring safety concerns in the district. In a response to another user, the individual being sought by the board described themselves as a teacher. \n\n>The board said it\u2019s considering a defamation lawsuit against the person responsible for posting the comments. But Reddit denies OCDSB\u2019s claim that the information is \u201cnecessary for it to determine whether to pursue a potential claim for defamation.\u201d\n\n>OCDSB \u2018vigorously defending\u2019 employees. In response to CBC\u2019s request for comment, OCDSB communications manager Diane Pernari said the board is committed to \u201cvigorously defending our employees against unfounded attacks and upholding our legal and ethical obligations.\u201d\n\n>She wrote the legal action underscores the board\u2019s \u201cunwavering dedication to creating a positive and supportive environment for all members of the OCDSB community.\u201d Known as a Norwich Order, the board\u2019s application seeks to compel a third party to provide information about alleged wrongdoing, even if the third party isn\u2019t directly involved in the wrongdoing.\n\n>Reddit did not respond to a request for comment. Lawyers for both parties are expected to have another court date later this year. \n\n>Court to consider free speech, defamation. Ottawa-based lawyer Karin Page said the school board will have to demonstrate the user\u2019s comments were defamatory, rather than just critical of its policies. \n\n>Page said the court will need to balance the public interest in protecting anonymous speech against the board\u2019s need to defend itself against alleged defamation. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between someone just voicing their opposition to a policy or ... to the government, or to disclosing their own personal situations,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a distinction between that and making defamatory statements online.\u201d\n\n>She added the fact the comments named or identified specific individuals is concerning, as it makes it difficult for those people to defend themselves.",

Maybe ban the user if it is determined a defamation case against them would succeed beyond reasonable doubt. Reddit giving up information to a smaller non-us court would almost certainly set a precedent of giving up any info requested by a larger government that is being overrun by Nazis. And that spooks me because that could be used for any number of things. \n\nSure, I could be worried about a slippery slope, but given it hasn't even been 2 months with Trump in office, I would like to avoid the risk over the next... 3.5 years...",

                "If Reddit caves to a school board what will they do when the Trump administration demands the same thing?",
                "This is a big test for Reddit if they will cave-in with the authoritarian school district board in Canada.\n\nGiving away user information will have bigger implication for this community. \n\nClearly, it was not defamation. OCDSB is a bully school board who doesn't care about their teachers and students."

                "#Tragic Toll: Four Harris County Officers Take Their Own Lives in Just Six Weeks\n\nQuiet grief has settled over Harris County as the community reels from the shocking loss of four current and former deputies, each taking their own life in the space of just six weeks. The most recent was Deputy Christina Kohler, a well-respected veteran whose death last week was officially ruled a suicide. She was just 37.\n\nKohler had been reported missing, sparking concern across the force. A public alert was issued and the search began. Days later, on 13 March, her body was found. The news stunned friends and colleagues. Just three days after Kohler's death, former deputy Maria Vasquez, who left the sheriff's office in December, also died by apparent suicide. Then, earlier this week, another former deputy, William Bozeman, was found dead. The pattern is as heartbreaking as it is alarming.\n\n\u201cIt caught a lot of us by surprise,\u201d said Jose Lopez, president of the Harris County Deputies' Organisation. \u201cOne is too many. Two? Three? Yes, it's devastating.\u201d\n\nLopez, who had known two of the fallen deputies for over twenty years, has been helping colleagues come to terms with the grief. He\u2019s also grappling with the death of former deputy Long Nguyen, who took his own life in early February at the age of 58. For Lopez, the pain is personal. For the department, it\u2019s a wake-up call.\n\nThere is growing concern about the toll this profession takes on those who serve. Policing is a job that deals daily with trauma, danger and confrontation. It can grind away at a person\u2019s mental health until there is very little left to give. Dr Thomas McNeese, who heads up the Sheriff's Office Behavioural Health Division, is all too aware of the emotional weight deputies carry. His team offers peer-to-peer support and has been working since 2020 to provide help, but even he admits the past few weeks have been especially hard.\n\n\u201cThis profession takes a toll,\u201d said McNeese. \u201cThe longer you're in it, the more it changes you.\u201d\n\nLaw enforcement officers have long been known to suffer disproportionately from mental health issues and suicide. The nature of the work, the things they witness, the pressure to remain composed in the face of chaos, it all builds up. McNeese is urging those who are struggling to reach out, to talk, to act.\n\n\u201cGetting help, doing something to not stay stuck, that\u2019s important,\u201d he said.\n\nInside the department, questions are being asked. Despite the resources already in place, Lopez wonders if it is enough. Is there more they could be doing? Is something being missed?\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t help but ask,\u201d he said. \u201cDo we need to take a different approach?\u201d",
                "I want to say someone is covering their tracks, the guilty are taking the easy way out before the hammer falls or a little bit of both.\n\nOn the other hand, suicide is often contagious.",
