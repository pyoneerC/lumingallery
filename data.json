I used to be a regular customer and haven\u2019t gone back since. \n\nIt\u2019s wild how they alienated and completely destroyed their base in just over a year.",
                "\"Go woke go broke, am I right?\" LMAO. It's hilarious to me these big corporations took the the threat of....broke ass people who don't spend any money in their stores anyway....seriously. Instead they decide to piss off the people who have money and \\*used\\* to shop there. \n\nKeep soaring, Costco!"
