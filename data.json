United missed a sharp turn they would have had to make and spent extra time on the runway. The Tower then cleared the other aircraft to take off on that runway, not realizing United missed the turn and was still on the runway.  \n\nThe simple solution is that Tower should always control the runway.  Ground can do the taxiways, but having 2 people clear people into the same space is stupid.",

                "Eh, unless 200 orders for these are coming in, nuclear\u00a0 dead. I like nuclear. But from an economic standpoint it's dead. For the time it takes to install, you can build a wind farm and start generating revenue from the day you connect the first wind turbine. Same for solar nuclear though, it's gonna take 5 years even for a SMR to get it turned on, if you're lucky. And with the first one off the line, we're more likely to see the f47 take flight than this thing to turn on.\u00a0\n\n\nNow as for all the idiots who want to mention safety, light water SMRs have been operating\u00a0 for decades aboard US Naval ships and subs, without a single accident for 70 years. There's no industrial safety record in any industry that even approaches it. There's a few things about light water reactors that actually make them safer, though not as uranium efficient as their larger counterparts, much like how a campfire is much safer and easier to manage than a bonfire, you're just heating a smaller space.\u00a0\n\n\nAbout the only thing the NRC is built to handle regulation wise is a light water reactor. The science has practically been solved for decades and grad students can build validated working models that run on laptops these days.",
                "I don\u2019t usually like privatization, but I\u2019m glad to see that nuclear energy is finally gaining traction. We need to start funding science again so we can work on nuclear fusion and all this other stuff.",

                "The modern safety standards for small modular reactors don't exist. These SMRs are not currently powering cities anywhere in the US. Afaik There are no real world examples to look to in terms of what is safe/works and what doesn't when these SMRs are live, patched into the grid. SMR developers want to regulate as they innovate.\n\nThese same companies and states that want nuclear, like Utah, are suing the NRC to allow SMRs to be regulated by each state independently in order to create a competitive regulatory environment in the hopes of speeding up the process by which modern safety standards can be made. \n\nWhile speeding up innovation to outcompete foreign development is a good goal, speeding up regulation by regulating as you go may result in increased risk.\n\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/nrc-lawsuit-nuclear-energy-reactor-smr-regulation-regulatory-commission/",
                "This is prob a little off topic but in the Fallout universe the companies who handle the nuclear power almost always dispose of the waste in the most shady and comically dangerous ways possible to save a buck wherever they can and I feel like that's just gonna be a reality now. lol."
