If they can\u2019t clean it up in a way that gives the bees time to find their own queens among the wreckage, almost all of them are doomed. And it\u2019ll be a total loss for the farmers, pending insurance. California farmers need to find more bees or not get pollinated, Washington farmers need to replace the bees they\u2019ve raised. Local region gets a bunch of stressed out honeybees with nowhere to go. It\u2019ll take some really careful mitigation to recover it all, on top of handling the accident and the surrounding humanity.\u00a0\n\nAlso, ridiculous that our farming infrastructure requires bee imports for pollination. How about boost the habitat around the farms and cut down on the monoculture crops? All the highways and stormwater ditches should be no-mow in the dry summer. Retain moisture in the vegetation and give a wildlife coordinator to connect habitat fragments and boost pollination. And save on public works maintenance costs. The problem for these bees is that there are no flowers most of the summer, and then a mega monoculture blooms and expects there to be billions of bees and butterflies to support it. But also here\u2019s neurological pesticides like neonics to kill the \u201cbad bugs.\u201d You reap what you sow.\u00a0",

And it\u2019ll be a total loss for the farmers, pending insurance. California farmers need to find more bees or not get pollinated, Washington farmers need to replace the bees they\u2019ve raised.

It\u2019ll take some really careful mitigation to recover it all, on top of handling the accident and the surrounding humanity.\u00a0\n\nAlso, ridiculous that our farming infrastructure requires bee imports for pollination. How about boost the habitat around the farms and cut down on the monoculture crops? All the highways and stormwater ditches should be no-mow in the dry summer. Retain moisture in the vegetation and give a wildlife coordinator to connect habitat fragments and boost pollination. And save on public works maintenance costs. The problem for these bees is that there are no flowers most of the summer, and then a mega monoculture blooms and expects there to be billions of bees and butterflies to support it.

                "They aren't wasting time kicking people out either. My son found out Job Corps was being shutdown yesterday on the 29th, received his plane ticket today (the 30th), and will being flown back home on Monday (the 2nd). Less than a week from learning they are being closed and being shipped out.\n\nWhile we are happy to have him back and will support him in anyway we can, a lot of his classmates come from troubled or abusive homes. And Job Corps what they chance to break free. Some of them have been told they aren't welcome back home and are suddenly facing homelessness. They are just being sent to the closest airport to where they came from and then being left to their own devices.\n\nedit: just an addendum. We live 3 hours from the airport my son is going to be arriving at. There was no communication with us to make sure anyone would be able to be there to pick him up. He didn't find out until early evening, so he called me to tell me his flight time about 20 minutes before my offices closed for the weekend. Now I'm lucky that I have a job that I can take time off from with short notice to go pick him on Monday. But I've definitely had jobs in the past that would have refused to let me take time off with such short notice. \n\nCompare this to when he joined Job Corp and they took care of all the transportation. They picked him up from home and took him to the closest Job Corp facility and from there took him to the airport. How many of these kids are just being flown out, and even if their parents want to go get them, are not able to do so? Maybe they don't have a reliable vehicle, maybe they can't afford the trip, maybe they can't get time off from work. There are many reasons why they might not be able to drop everything and pick their child up with so little notice.",

And it\u2019ll be a total loss for the farmers, pending insurance. California farmers need to find more bees or not get pollinated, Washington farmers need to replace the bees they\u2019ve raised. Local region gets a bunch of stressed out honeybees with nowhere to go. It\u2019ll take some really careful mitigation to recover it all, on top of handling the accident and the surrounding humanity.\u00a0\n\nAlso, ridiculous that our farming infrastructure requires bee imports for pollination. How about boost the habitat around the farms and cut down on the monoculture crops? All the highways and stormwater ditches should be no-mow in the dry summer. Retain moisture in the vegetation and give a wildlife coordinator to connect habitat fragments and boost pollination. And save on public works maintenance costs. The problem for these bees is that there are no flowers most of the summer, and then a mega monoculture blooms and expects there to be billions of bees and butterflies to support it.
