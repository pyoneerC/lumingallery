                "Beyond the actual rankings, there's some good insights here, about what makes for a happy society:\n\n>**Researchers say that beyond health and wealth, some factors that influence happiness sound deceptively simple: sharing meals with others, having somebody to count on for social support, and household size**. In Mexico and Europe, for example, a household size of four to five people predicts the highest levels of happiness, the study said.\n\n>**Believing in the kindness of others is also much more closely tied to happiness than previously thought**, according to the latest findings.\n\n>As an example, the report suggests that **people who believe that others are willing to return their lost wallet is a strong predictor of the overall happiness of a population**.\n\n>Nordic nations rank among the top places for expected and actual return of lost wallets, the study found.\n\n>Overall, researchers said **global evidence on the perceived and actual return of lost wallets shows that people are much too pessimistic about the kindness of their communities compared to reality** \u2014 actual rates of wallet return are around twice as high as people expect.\n\n>...\n\n>Experts in economics, psychology, sociology and beyond then seek to explain the variations across countries and over time using factors such as **GDP per capita, healthy\u00a0life expectancy, having someone to count on, a sense of freedom, generosity and perceptions of\u00a0corruption**.\n\nIt's a good reminder that a sense of community, personal relationships, and social solidarity add real value to people's lives.\n\nI think that sometimes gets missed, when changes in society are evaluated almost solely by their implications for economics and efficiency.  Those are important too, but they're not everything.",

That is a 39% increase compared to 2006.\n\n\nWe already have one generation of people who are effectively islands unto themselves. The fact that the next generation is already starting off alone isn't going to bode well.\n\n\nAlso, Mexico being in #10 despite some of the horiffic things that happen there should raise some alarm bells on how the United States functions as a society.

The best pride events are local gatherings,\u00a0 in parks with picnics.\u00a0 The ones with all the glam and glitz were just that - glam and glitz. I'd much rather spend an afternoon with friends and neighbors just hanging out than have music and glitz being pumped at me.\u00a0\n\n\nFor those of us who celebrate togetherness and community, the loss of corporate money won't bother us much. Many of us also tend to support local versus corporate as well.\u00a0",

The deletion has hindered efforts to rescue the children and prosecute those responsible, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Yale project, funded by the US government until last month, monitored 116 sites in Russia using satellite imagery and other surveillance tools.\n\nSources suggest the deletion may have been accidental or intentional, raising potential legal risks for the Trump administration under international war crimes laws. The lost data was also being shared with the EU for its own investigations. The destruction of evidence not only affects legal cases but also complicates ongoing rescue missions.\n\nThe Yale project played a key role in gathering evidence that contributed to six ICC indictments, including against Putin and his commissioner for children\u2019s rights. Russia has been accused of forcibly transferring Ukrainian children, issuing Russian passports in occupied areas, and erasing Ukrainian identity. The loss of the secure \u201cCaesar\u201d database has been described as a violation of the Geneva Convention, which prohibits destroying war crimes evidence.

                "I want to draw attention to something important that I think a lot of people gloss over in discussion of Israel's military campaign in Gaza - *combat zones*.\n\nThe associated press recently [put out this map](https://i.imgur.com/Rym5mqu.jpeg), an estimation of the boundaries of the IDF's so called combat zones - invisible lines which the Israeli military draws and declares anyone within as a valid military target by virtue of their presence.\n\nAs you can see by the map, these \"combat zones\" are typically very broad, and also aren't actually well defined. Despite this, the IDF uses their existence to justify civilian casualties by asserting that anyone present in them *must* be Hamas or someone trying to martyr themselves. In case it wasn't obvious, these combat zones often cover neighborhoods home to tens of thousands of people. \n\nImagine if - for instance, the Peoples Liberation Army decided that actually the entirety of Harlem was a combat region (without even making that information available to New Yorkers beforehand) and killed anyone present. I don't think many would regard this as much more than the wanton murder of civilians.\n\nAnd I am not being hyperbolic about these killings - take for instance the case of two elderly Palestinian civilians who were killed as reported originally by [HaMakom](https://www.ha-makom.co.il/1057919-2/) (in Hebrew) and can be read about in English [here](https://euromedmonitor.org/en/article/6621/Euro-Med-Monitor-reveals-details-of-Israeli-army%E2%80%99s-execution-of-elderly-Palestinian-couple-after-it-used-them-as-human-shields) or [here](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-02-16/ty-article/idf-reportedly-used-elderly-gazan-as-human-shield-tied-explosive-around-his-neck/00000195-0e56-d1b4-a7fd-cf7742bf0000). Essentially, IDF forces abducted an elderly Palestinian man and forced him to enter suspected booby-trapped buildings (as part of the alleged ***Mosquito Protocol***). Eventually, he and his wife were released; however, the IDF unit that abducted them did not inform the other units operating in the area that they had done so, so shortly after their release, **the 80 year old man and his wife were shot dead by Israeli forces operating in the area**.\n\nAnother report by [Haaertz](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-12-18/ty-article-magazine/.premium/idf-soldiers-expose-arbitrary-killings-and-rampant-lawlessness-in-gazas-netzarim-corridor/00000193-da7f-de86-a9f3-fefff2e50000) focuses on the Netzarim corridor, one of the most infamous examples of these kill zones. I will leave you with the following quotes from soldiers:\n\n>*Every woman is a scout, or a man in disguise ... Anyone on a bicycle could be killed, claiming cyclists were terrorists*\n\n...\n\n>\"After shootings, bodies are not collected, attracting packs of dogs who come to eat them.\"\n\n...\n\n>\"One time, guards spotted someone approaching from the south. We responded as if it was a large militant raid. We took positions and just opened fire.\n\n>I'm talking about dozens of bullets, maybe more. For about a minute or two, we just kept shooting at the body. People around me were shooting and laughing.\"\n\n>When they approached the body, the soldier said they discovered that the person they had just gunned down was \"just a boy, maybe 16 (years old).\"\n\n>The battalion commander responded: \"Anyone crossing the line is a terrorist, no exceptions, no civilians. Everyone's a terrorist.\"\n\n...\n\n>\"The sight haunts me,\" said the soldier in his account in the report. Three of the Palestinians were killed in the barrage, while the survived with his hands in the air.\n\n>\"We put him in a cage set up near our position, stripped off his clothes, and left him there,\" the soldier recounts.\n\n>\"Soldiers passing by spat on him. It was disgusting. Finally, a military interrogator came, questioned him briefly while holding a gun to his head, then ordered his release.\"\n\nPerhaps these soldiers are lying. Perhaps the fact that their stories of indiscriminate killing seemingly independently cooberate one another, and reports from [doctors](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/09/opinion/gaza-doctor-interviews.html), [humanitarian organizations](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/12/amnesty-international-concludes-israel-is-committing-genocide-against-palestinians-in-gaza/), the [UN](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/countries/opt/20241106-Gaza-Update-Report-OPT.pdf), and the [ICC](https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/statement-icc-prosecutor-karim-aa-khan-kc-applications-arrest-warrants-situation-state) is merely a coincidence. I certainly do not *want* these reports to be true - *it would be preferable to imagine this as some grand antisemetic conspiracy* rather than think that reports like that of:\n\n>\"\tOne Division 99 reservist recalled watching a video feed from a drone showing \"an adult with two children crossing the forbidden line.\" \n\n>\"We had them under complete surveillance with the drone and weapons aimed at them\u2014they couldn't do anything,\" he said. **\"Suddenly we heard a massive explosion. A combat helicopter had fired a missile at them.** Who thinks it's legitimate to fire a missile at children? And with a helicopter? This is pure evil.\" \n\n...are real. But I find evidence that this is an elaborate hoax to be lacking.\n\nI find it disturbing that so few people seem to be aware of these reports - neighborhoods and their residents being so casually designated for termination - dozens of *Bucha*s happening with the West's enthusiastic support, and I hope that having read these accounts you understand why some people find Israel's military operations in Gaza objectionable.",

In Mexico and Europe, for example, a household size of four to five people predicts the highest levels of happiness, the study said.\n\n>**Believing in the kindness of others is also much more closely tied to happiness than previously thought**, according to the latest findings.\n\n>As an example, the report suggests that **people who believe that others are willing to return their lost wallet is a strong predictor of the overall happiness of a population**.\n\n>Nordic nations rank among the top places for expected and actual return of lost wallets, the study found.\n\n>Overall, researchers said **global evidence on the perceived and actual return of lost wallets shows that people are much too pessimistic about the kindness of their communities compared to reality** \u2014 actual rates of wallet return are around twice as high as people expect.\n\n>...\n\n>Experts in economics, psychology, sociology and beyond then seek to explain the variations across countries and over time using factors such as **GDP per capita, healthy\u00a0life expectancy, having someone to count on, a sense of freedom, generosity and perceptions of\u00a0corruption**.\n\nIt's a good reminder that a sense of community, personal relationships, and social solidarity add real value to people's lives.\n\nI think that sometimes gets missed, when changes in society are evaluated almost solely by their implications for economics and efficiency.

Savannah, GA to New York *Palmetto*, Charlotte to New York *Carolinian* services for example are state funded because that\u2019s the law, Amtrak is just the contractor. \n\nNot only this but Amtraks charter requires them to be profitable meaning that LD services are insanely expensive. \n\nIf we want Amtrak to be successful then we need to allow it to be far more independent than it already is.
