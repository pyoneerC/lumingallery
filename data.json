It's all too late but just like the business leaders seeing the economic devastation Trump is causing and finally coming around, many judges are starting to realize that Trump is trying to make them powerless and obsolete. They're like cops, they'll protect their own. And there's a potential tipping point here.",

By mass deleting everything to non recoverability, they can\u2019t actually rehire anyone because they have no paperwork to enable them to do so. It was a deliberate choice to destroy those records just in case they were forced to reinstate them, or if they were all thrown out of office and new management took over.",
