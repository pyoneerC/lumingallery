Were it not for that he'd have broken it likely several seasons ago. He also broke his leg this season and missed 5 weeks in recovery. And despite all that, he still scored 42 goals to pass the Great One for the all time lead. Had he not missed time this year, there's a good chance he'd have the lead for most goals on the season too. A truly remarkable player and remarkable moment for the sport.",

One of the best champions of the game today. Congratulations Ovi, you earned this record and I'm sure it will stand for many years.",
