                "\"Days after the Myanmar quake, the U.S. made its first announcement of help: It was sending a three-member assessment team of non-specialist advisers from a regional USAID office in Bangkok, Thailand. Coincidentally, like hundreds of other USAID staffers around the world, the three had received layoff notices from the Trump administration on March 28 within hours of the quake, current and former USAID officials confirmed.\"",
                ">China shares a border and close ties with Myanmar. Chinese rescuers had their first success Sunday, fewer than 48 hours after the quake, when they joined hands with local people to pull an elderly man from a badly damaged hospital in the capital city of Naypyitaw.\n\n>By Wednesday, Chinese rescuers had pulled out nine survivors, including a pregnant woman and a child. In Mandalay, Chinese rescuers saved a 52-year-old man who trapped for nearly 125 hours.\n\nFor an administration that talks plenty about countering China, shit like this is boneheaded. In these developing countries, when a more pro-China and a more pro-US candidate are going head to head voters are gonna remember it was the Chinese saving them when disasters stuck.",

In my work capacity I am handling emergency projects daily but other members of the SAP may go years without any real experience. \n\nThe point is, that it is on our best interests as a country to help other countries because valuable experience, knowledge and contacts are made that will directly benefit our abilities to respond. \n\nFEMA, SAP and other similar programs need qualified, experienced and knowledgeable members. \n\nThis presidency from a know nothing president and his team will cause damage that will be felt years from now. \n\nI mean we all know he is awful but in every thing he does when you drill down further you realize how much more harmful he is.",

Economic concerns, particularly inflation and job security, were primary factors influencing this shift among Latino voters.
