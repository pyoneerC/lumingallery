The fine was then doubled \u201cpursuant to an escalating penalty structure for repeat riding crop violations within the previous 180 days,\u201d resulting in a $62,000 fine, according to HISA.\n\nAlvarado was found to have struck Sovereignty eight times during the Kentucky Derby, which was his second offense in 180 days, per a HISA ruling. HISA protocol allows jockeys to strike horses a maximum of six times during a race.\n\nThe jockey was also suspended for two Kentucky racing days, May 29 and 30, as a result of the violation.\n\nThe jockey and Sovereignty won the 151st running of the Kentucky Derby last Saturday at Churchill Downs.",

You can whip the shit out of yourself and it isn't particularly painful, even on bare skin and in sensitive areas. The sound and the sensation are absolutely used to continue encouraging the horse to move forward. The limit was put into place to prevent an obscene amount of strikes going down the stretch. It is absolutely possible to lose track with the adrenaline of everything, especially once a jockey and horse fall into rhythm. The only type of legal whip used in US racing now is usually fiberglass wrapped in thick foam. It is designed to cause a loud sound more than cause pain.\n\n> For the record, jockeys won't make millions riding one race: they take home roughly 10% of the earnings. Jose Alvarado took home $310,000 for his effort; he acknowledges his mistake, he understands he was one strike over, and he will pay his $31,000 fine.\nUnsure if links are allowed, but this is a pretty fair assessment of the use of whips in racing.\n\n> https://lightupracing.com/why-are-whips-used-in-racing/",

Thats the HARD part that needs a lot of infrastructure, power and skill.\n\nThere is a new one under construction in California. Its a $1.8Bln facility, owned by an Australian company. Otherwise the ore has to be export to Australia, Chile or China. The US does have some other processing capabilities, but its mostly the Aussies with the know-how (I guess it involves using shitty beer to do it? j/k). \n\nBear in mind that if its processed abroad thats 2 x shipping costs, plus hazards materials handling, plus a tariff.\n\nSo that $1.8Bln plant, even if its a smaller facility, will be really useful! But its not going to be able to handle all of it, or in a timely manner.\n\nThis is a good link for more info: [Lithium Supply Chain: Understanding the Basics | Shipping and Commodity Academy](https://shippingandcommodityacademy.com/blog/lithium-supply-chain-understanding-the-basics/) (other pages exist but they all say about the same thing. Obviously the \"US reserves\" are now slightly higher than on that page mind).",

(There's a summer camp there that predates the smokestacks that kids roll around in the dirt right THERE.) \n\nIn Butte, Montana and subsequently a 200 mile radius and anywhere in the MT/WY/NV area there are both smokestack areas of contamination and pools of deadly chemicals leftover from the 1800s-1970s. Pools of arsenic and lead. If you've been there you know.  Cows and horses just walk around grazing in these areas.\n\nPicher, Oklahoma - \"the most toxic ghost town\" in the USA.

They just want to see you bougie houses and ride out the earthquakes.  (source - Geologist who works for oil company who quit over it I dated - so dubious.) \n\nQuestion is not \"We make money now\"\n\nbut \"Where will we live AFTER the mine closes and we don't make money anymore?\"\n\nExample of Lithium Extract- from source:\n\n# Brine Extraction\n\nBrine extraction is another method of extracting lithium. This method involves pumping brine from underground aquifers into evaporation ponds. The sun and wind evaporate the water, leaving behind lithium and other minerals. The following are the steps involved in brine extraction:\n\n* Drilling: Wells are drilled into the ground to access the brine.\n* Pumping: The brine is pumped to the surface and transported to the evaporation ponds.\n* Evaporation: The brine is evaporated in the ponds, leaving behind lithium and other minerals.\n* Processing: The extracted lithium is then processed to produce lithium carbonate or other lithium compounds.\n\nBrine extraction is a less costly and less energy-intensive method of extracting lithium. It is also less harmful to the environment than hard rock mining. However, it is highly dependent on weather conditions, and the process can take several months to complete.\n\nOverall, both hard rock mining and brine extraction have their advantages and disadvantages. Companies choose the method that suits their needs and resources.\n\n#",
                "For those unaware, the U.S. has lithium in a ton of places but as of now the only real site that is extracting lithium in any meaningful capacity is in Nevada. There is a site that has been identified for development in Arizona as well.\n\nBut all of that is sort of moot because right now virtually all REFINING of lithium has to go through China so absent developing that domestic refining we won\u2019t be gaining independence any time soon.",

                "Alireza Doroudi, a 32-year-old Iranian doctoral student in mechanical engineering at the University of Alabama, has decided to voluntarily leave the United States after being detained for six weeks by immigration authorities.  His detention began in March 2025, despite the U.S. government later dropping one of the charges against him. \n\nDoroudi's student visa was revoked in June 2023 without explanation.  At that time, the university advised him that he could legally remain in the U.S. as long as he maintained his student status and did not leave the country.  In the spring of 2025, the government filed two charges to justify his deportation: the revoked visa and his alleged failure to maintain student status.  The first charge was withdrawn after the government acknowledged that the visa revocation was \"prudential\" and not immediately effective.  His attorney, David Rozas, is contesting the second charge. \n\nDespite having no criminal record or involvement in political activism, Doroudi was denied bond and held in a Louisiana detention facility.  Frustrated by the prolonged detention and the impact on his life, he chose to self-deport.  His fianc\u00e9e, Sama Ebrahimi Bajgani, and his attorney expressed deep sadness and questioned why he was targeted.

Stores will remain open for now, but the company isn\u2019t buying new inventory so bare shelves are likely become more common.\n\n>\u201cI think what we\u2019ll progressively see is the stores will become more and more spartan,\u201d said retail analyst Neil Saunders.\n\n>The company runs 1,245 stores in 15 states, according to its website. It has a heavy presence in New York, Pennsylvania and California, which alone has 347 locations.\n\n>Here\u2019s what customers can expect next.\n\n>Rite Aid says a few months for most of its stores. All locations will eventually close or be sold to a new owner.\n\n>Until then, customers will still be able to fill prescriptions, get immunizations and shop in the stores or online.\n\n>Rite Aid has said that it will stop issuing customer rewards points for purchases. It also will no longer honor gift cards or accept returns or exchanges starting next month.\n\n>Rite Aid will try to sell them to another drugstore, grocer or retailer with a pharmacy. The company says it is working to put together a \u201csmooth transfer\u201d of customer prescriptions to other pharmacies.\n\n>But there\u2019s no guarantee those files will wind up at a retailer near the location that is closing.\n\n>That may be challenging because some Rite Aid stores are in rural areas, miles away from another pharmacy, noted Saunders, managing director of the consulting and data analysis firm GlobalData.\n\n>Prescription files can be valuable assets because they can connect the acquiring drugstore with a regular customer if that person sticks with the new store.\n\n>Philadelphia-based Rite Aid had been closing stores and struggling with losses for years before its first bankruptcy filing in 2023. The company says its \u201conly viable path forward\u201d is a return to Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.\n\n>The company said in letter to vendors that it has been hit with several financial challenges that have grown more intense.\n\n>Rite Aid and its competitors have been dealing with tighter profits on their prescriptions, increased theft, [court settlements over opioid prescriptions](https://apnews.com/article/business-health-ohio-lawsuits-cleveland-21762b10e14a24bf0c67a4da04bdf606) and customers who are drifting to online shopping and discount retailers.\n\n>[Walgreens](https://apnews.com/general-news-64dd17e17aa147adb1fd83510f747139), which has more than six times as many stores as Rite Aid, [agreed in March](https://apnews.com/article/walgreens-buyout-private-sycamore-drugstore-4f4b33c34e61fe0e1b111107db4830fa) to be acquired by the private equity firm Sycamore Partners.\n\n>CVS Health [also has closed stores](https://apnews.com/article/drugstore-closings-cvs-walgreens-independent-pharmacies-6b54d4bd1564b2bff7a55a624da61c19).",

The fine was then doubled \u201cpursuant to an escalating penalty structure for repeat riding crop violations within the previous 180 days,\u201d resulting in a $62,000 fine, according to HISA.\n\nAlvarado was found to have struck Sovereignty eight times during the Kentucky Derby, which was his second offense in 180 days, per a HISA ruling. HISA protocol allows jockeys to strike horses a maximum of six times during a race.\n\nThe jockey was also suspended for two Kentucky racing days, May 29 and 30, as a result of the violation.\n\nThe jockey and Sovereignty won the 151st running of the Kentucky Derby last Saturday at Churchill Downs.",

You can whip the shit out of yourself and it isn't particularly painful, even on bare skin and in sensitive areas. The sound and the sensation are absolutely used to continue encouraging the horse to move forward. The limit was put into place to prevent an obscene amount of strikes going down the stretch. It is absolutely possible to lose track with the adrenaline of everything, especially once a jockey and horse fall into rhythm. The only type of legal whip used in US racing now is usually fiberglass wrapped in thick foam. It is designed to cause a loud sound more than cause pain.\n\n> For the record, jockeys won't make millions riding one race: they take home roughly 10% of the earnings. Jose Alvarado took home $310,000 for his effort; he acknowledges his mistake, he understands he was one strike over, and he will pay his $31,000 fine.\nUnsure if links are allowed, but this is a pretty fair assessment of the use of whips in racing.\n\n> https://lightupracing.com/why-are-whips-used-in-racing/",

Thats the HARD part that needs a lot of infrastructure, power and skill.\n\nThere is a new one under construction in California. Its a $1.8Bln facility, owned by an Australian company. Otherwise the ore has to be export to Australia, Chile or China. The US does have some other processing capabilities, but its mostly the Aussies with the know-how (I guess it involves using shitty beer to do it? j/k). \n\nBear in mind that if its processed abroad thats 2 x shipping costs, plus hazards materials handling, plus a tariff.\n\nSo that $1.8Bln plant, even if its a smaller facility, will be really useful! But its not going to be able to handle all of it, or in a timely manner.\n\nThis is a good link for more info: [Lithium Supply Chain: Understanding the Basics | Shipping and Commodity Academy](https://shippingandcommodityacademy.com/blog/lithium-supply-chain-understanding-the-basics/) (other pages exist but they all say about the same thing. Obviously the \"US reserves\" are now slightly higher than on that page mind).",

(There's a summer camp there that predates the smokestacks that kids roll around in the dirt right THERE.) \n\nIn Butte, Montana and subsequently a 200 mile radius and anywhere in the MT/WY/NV area there are both smokestack areas of contamination and pools of deadly chemicals leftover from the 1800s-1970s. Pools of arsenic and lead. If you've been there you know.  Cows and horses just walk around grazing in these areas.\n\nPicher, Oklahoma - \"the most toxic ghost town\" in the USA.

They just want to see you bougie houses and ride out the earthquakes.  (source - Geologist who works for oil company who quit over it I dated - so dubious.) \n\nQuestion is not \"We make money now\"\n\nbut \"Where will we live AFTER the mine closes and we don't make money anymore?\"\n\nExample of Lithium Extract- from source:\n\n# Brine Extraction\n\nBrine extraction is another method of extracting lithium. This method involves pumping brine from underground aquifers into evaporation ponds. The sun and wind evaporate the water, leaving behind lithium and other minerals. The following are the steps involved in brine extraction:\n\n* Drilling: Wells are drilled into the ground to access the brine.\n* Pumping: The brine is pumped to the surface and transported to the evaporation ponds.\n* Evaporation: The brine is evaporated in the ponds, leaving behind lithium and other minerals.\n* Processing: The extracted lithium is then processed to produce lithium carbonate or other lithium compounds.\n\nBrine extraction is a less costly and less energy-intensive method of extracting lithium. It is also less harmful to the environment than hard rock mining. However, it is highly dependent on weather conditions, and the process can take several months to complete.\n\nOverall, both hard rock mining and brine extraction have their advantages and disadvantages. Companies choose the method that suits their needs and resources.\n\n#",
                "For those unaware, the U.S. has lithium in a ton of places but as of now the only real site that is extracting lithium in any meaningful capacity is in Nevada. There is a site that has been identified for development in Arizona as well.\n\nBut all of that is sort of moot because right now virtually all REFINING of lithium has to go through China so absent developing that domestic refining we won\u2019t be gaining independence any time soon.",

                "Alireza Doroudi, a 32-year-old Iranian doctoral student in mechanical engineering at the University of Alabama, has decided to voluntarily leave the United States after being detained for six weeks by immigration authorities.  His detention began in March 2025, despite the U.S. government later dropping one of the charges against him. \n\nDoroudi's student visa was revoked in June 2023 without explanation.  At that time, the university advised him that he could legally remain in the U.S. as long as he maintained his student status and did not leave the country.  In the spring of 2025, the government filed two charges to justify his deportation: the revoked visa and his alleged failure to maintain student status.  The first charge was withdrawn after the government acknowledged that the visa revocation was \"prudential\" and not immediately effective.  His attorney, David Rozas, is contesting the second charge. \n\nDespite having no criminal record or involvement in political activism, Doroudi was denied bond and held in a Louisiana detention facility.  Frustrated by the prolonged detention and the impact on his life, he chose to self-deport.  His fianc\u00e9e, Sama Ebrahimi Bajgani, and his attorney expressed deep sadness and questioned why he was targeted.
