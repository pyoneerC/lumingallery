Likewise it makes it harder to explain the problem here, as it phrases the complaint as against people being sent back to their country of origin.\n\nTo be clear we aren't deporting people from the country; we are using U.S. taxpayer dollars to pay a dictator to imprison and disappear hundreds (so far) of foreign nationals from 3rd party countries at the behest of the U.S. executive branch.\n\n(Not that there are no problems with the deportations/process in general, but that is much harder to communicate.)",

These charges shouldn't even have happened. The law they're trying to enforce was barred by another judge for the time being.
