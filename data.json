                "**Key facts before the politics start flying:**\n\n* **What happened** \u2013 A nocturnal tornado outbreak late 17 May killed at least 27 people across Kentucky and Missouri (18 of them in Laurel County, KY). Radar\u2010based debris signatures appeared before midnight, but the first *official* warnings for parts of the path weren\u2019t pushed until minutes after circulation was already on the ground.\n\n* **Why the gap matters** \u2013 For night-time storms you\u2019re asleep until a phone alert blares. Even a 5- to 10-minute lag can be the difference between getting to a basement and dying in bed.\n\n* **Staffing reality** \u2013 The Jackson, KY forecast office that covers Laurel County has been running 31 % below its authorised staffing since DOGE-mandated cuts early this year. The overnight forecaster position\u2014whose only job is to watch radar while everyone else sleeps\u2014was eliminated in April. Nearly half of NWS offices now have 20 %+ vacancy rates, according to an Associated Press analysis.\n\n* **Warnings on the night** \u2013 Because the office can\u2019t staff 24/7 anymore, an on-call meteorologist had to remote-log-in when rotation ramped up. That start-up window accounts for the delay you see in the warning logs.\n\n* **Experts warned this would happen** \u2013 Meteorologists and the employees\u2019 union flagged the risk in February; The NY Times, PBS, and WaPo all ran pieces in the past month on how the same budget axe was forcing eight forecast offices\u2014including Jackson\u2014to drop round-the-clock coverage.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nThe science isn\u2019t broken; the funding pipeline is. Cut the people who keep eyes on radar at 11 p.m. and you buy tragedy at midnight."

The former president's office added that the cancer is hormone-sensitive, meaning it can likely be managed.\n\n>This is a developing story.\n\n>This breaking news story is being updated and more details will be published shortly.

However, every now and then there are some really nasty aggressive forms. Unfortunately, it sounds like the former president might be dealing with the latter. I\u2019ll be praying for him.",

Without telling my parents.\n\nMom was called in to come get the speculum I'd chosen. Dad found it hilarious. Mom was not impressed. \n\n(We'd later raid his bag and use the surgical tubing in our slingshots. We could shoot a glass marble through an empty oil can with those.

Radar\u2010based debris signatures appeared before midnight, but the first *official* warnings for parts of the path weren\u2019t pushed until minutes after circulation was already on the ground.\n\n* **Why the gap matters** \u2013 For night-time storms you\u2019re asleep until a phone alert blares. Even a 5- to 10-minute lag can be the difference between getting to a basement and dying in bed.\n\n* **Staffing reality** \u2013 The Jackson, KY forecast office that covers Laurel County has been running 31 % below its authorised staffing since DOGE-mandated cuts early this year. The overnight forecaster position\u2014whose only job is to watch radar while everyone else sleeps\u2014was eliminated in April. Nearly half of NWS offices now have 20 %+ vacancy rates, according to an Associated Press analysis.\n\n* **Warnings on the night** \u2013 Because the office can\u2019t staff 24/7 anymore, an on-call meteorologist had to remote-log-in when rotation ramped up. That start-up window accounts for the delay you see in the warning logs.\n\n* **Experts warned this would happen** \u2013 Meteorologists and the employees\u2019 union flagged the risk in February; The NY Times, PBS, and WaPo all ran pieces in the past month on how the same budget axe was forcing eight forecast offices\u2014including Jackson\u2014to drop round-the-clock coverage.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nThe science isn\u2019t broken; the funding pipeline is. Cut the people who keep eyes on radar at 11 p.m. and you buy tragedy at midnight."

Radar\u2010based debris signatures appeared before midnight, but the first *official* warnings for parts of the path weren\u2019t pushed until minutes after circulation was already on the ground.\n\n* **Why the gap matters** \u2013 For night-time storms you\u2019re asleep until a phone alert blares. Even a 5- to 10-minute lag can be the difference between getting to a basement and dying in bed.\n\n* **Staffing reality** \u2013 The Jackson, KY forecast office that covers Laurel County has been running 31 % below its authorised staffing since DOGE-mandated cuts early this year. The overnight forecaster position\u2014whose only job is to watch radar while everyone else sleeps\u2014was eliminated in April. Nearly half of NWS offices now have 20 %+ vacancy rates, according to an Associated Press analysis.\n\n* **Warnings on the night** \u2013 Because the office can\u2019t staff 24/7 anymore, an on-call meteorologist had to remote-log-in when rotation ramped up. That start-up window accounts for the delay you see in the warning logs.\n\n* **Experts warned this would happen** \u2013 Meteorologists and the employees\u2019 union flagged the risk in February; The NY Times, PBS, and WaPo all ran pieces in the past month on how the same budget axe was forcing eight forecast offices\u2014including Jackson\u2014to drop round-the-clock coverage.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nThe science isn\u2019t broken; the funding pipeline is. Cut the people who keep eyes on radar at 11 p.m. and you buy tragedy at midnight."

That, I was not expecting.\u201d\n\nPoor kid who brought in the bullet case must have been feeling so good thinking, *\"What a badass I am\"* before his friend followed it up with the grenade.

According to staff at the local clinic, he was the first and last person a lot of people in town ever saw. \n\nHe had a box in the garage filled with all kind of stuff that he'd taken out of his medicine bag. Expired medicine, gadgets gifted by medical reps, equipment he didn't need at the moment, you name it.\n\nAs a kid, the box fascinated me. One morning, I remembered that I needed to bring something to school for show-and-tell and decided to take something from the box. Without telling my parents.\n\nMom was called in to come get the speculum I'd chosen. Dad found it hilarious. Mom was not impressed. \n\n(We'd later raid his bag and use the surgical tubing in our slingshots. We could shoot a glass marble through an empty oil can with those. It's a miracle we didn't maim anyone. )"
