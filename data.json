These groups temporarily occupied and vandalized the building before being arrested by law enforcement officers from UWPD, the Seattle Police Department and the Washington State Patrol. They also set fire to dumpsters in a nearby street after blocking exits in the IEB and blocking nearby streets to delay firefighters\u2019 access.\n\nThis was no peaceful protest in support of Palestinian rights or against the war in Gaza. I condemn this dangerous, violent and illegal building occupation and related vandalism. I also condemn in the strongest terms the group\u2019s statement celebrating the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians. The University will not be intimidated by this sort of horrific and destructive behavior and will not engage in dialogue with any group using or condoning such destructive tactics. We will continue our actions to oppose antisemitism, racism and all forms of biases so that ALL our students, faculty, staff and visitors can feel safe and welcome on our campuses.\n\nKing County jail staff are working to identify the roughly 30 people who were arrested, so at the moment we do not know how many are UW students or community members. We are working with law enforcement and through our own disciplinary processes to ensure those responsible face appropriate consequences for their actions. And we will continue to stand strong against violent and illegal activities that create a hostile environment for any and all members of our community. I want to thank the members of UWPD and our law enforcement partners for their assistance in bringing this situation to a swift resolution.",

                "**This article is talking about a unilateral stop of Aid in February but Hegseth:**\n\n\n\nThe president was unaware of Hegseth\u2019s order, as were other top national security officials in the meeting, according to two sources briefed on the private White House discussions and another with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nAsked to comment on this report, the White House told Reuters that Hegseth had followed a directive from Trump to pause aid to Ukraine, which it said was the administration's position at the time. It did not explain why, according to those who spoke to Reuters, top national security officials in the normal decision making process didn\u2019t know about the order or why it was so swiftly reversed.\n\n\u201cNegotiating an end to the Russia-Ukraine War has been a complex and fluid situation. We are not going to detail every conversation among top administration officials throughout the process,\u201d said Karoline Leavitt, the White House spokeswoman. \u201cThe bottom line is the war is much closer to an end today than it was when President Trump took office.\u201d\n\nThe cancelations cost TRANSCOM $2.2 million, according to the records reviewed by Reuters. In response to a request for comment, TRANSCOM said that the total cost was $1.6 million \u2013 11 flights were canceled but one incurred no charge.\n\nAn order halting military aid authorized under the Biden administration went into effect officially a month later, on March 4, with a White House announcement.\n\nThe story of how flights were canceled, detailed by Reuters for the first time, points to an at-times haphazard policy-making process within the Trump administration and a command structure that is unclear even to its own ranking members.\n\nThe multiday pause of the flights, confirmed by five people with knowledge of it, also shows confusion in how the administration has created and implemented national security policy. At the Pentagon, the disarray is an open secret, with many current and former officials saying the department is plagued by internal disagreements on foreign policy, deep-seated grudges, and inexperienced staff.\n\nReuters couldn\u2019t establish exactly when Hegseth\u2019s office ordered the freight flights canceled. Two sources said Ukrainian and European officials began asking about the pause on February 2. The TRANSCOM records indicate that there was a verbal order from \u201cSECDEF\u201d \u2013 the secretary of defense \u2013 that stopped the flights and that they had resumed by February 5.\n\n\u201cThis is consistent with the administration's policy to move fast, break things and sort it out later. That is their managing philosophy,\u201d said Mark Cancian, a retired Marine officer and defense expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank. \u201cThat is great for Silicon Valley. But when you\u2019re talking about institutions that have been around for hundreds of years, you are going to run into problems.\u201d\nThe stop in shipments caused consternation in Kyiv.\nThe Ukrainians quickly asked the administration through multiple channels but had difficulty obtaining any useful information, according to a Ukrainian official with direct knowledge of the situation. In later conversations with the Ukrainians, the administration wrote off the pause as \u201cinternal politics,\u201d said the source. Ukrainian officials did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe shipping of American weapons to Ukraine requires sign-off from multiple agencies and can take weeks or even months to complete, depending on the size of the cargo. The majority of US military assistance goes through a logistics hub in Poland before being picked up by Ukrainian representatives and transported into the country.\n\nThat hub can hold shipments for extended periods of time. It\u2019s not clear if the 11 canceled flights were the only ones scheduled that week in February, how much aid was already stockpiled in Poland and if it continued to flow into Ukraine despite the TRANSCOM orders.\n\nThe revelations come at a time of upheaval in the department. Several of Hegseth\u2019s top advisers were escorted from the building April 15 after being accused of unauthorized disclosure of classified information. The secretary continues to face scrutiny, including from Congress, about his own communications. Previously he\u2019s attributed allegations of upheaval to disgruntled employees.\n\nThe canceled flights contained weapons that had long been approved by the Biden administration, authorized by lawmakers on Capitol Hill.\n\nReuters couldn\u2019t determine if Hegseth or his team knew how the order to TRANSCOM would play out or that the order would be a substantial change in U.S. policy on Ukraine. Three sources familiar with the situation said Hegseth misinterpreted discussions with the president about Ukraine policy and aid shipments without elaborating further.\n\nFour other people briefed on the situation said a small cadre of staffers inside the Pentagon, many of whom have never held a government job and who have for years spoken out against U.S. aid to Ukraine, advised Hegseth to consider pausing aid to the country.\n\nTwo people familiar with the matter denied there was a true cutoff in aid. One of them described it as a logistical pause.\n\u201c(They) just wanted to get a handle on what was going on and people, as a result, misinterpreted that as: \u2018You need to stop everything,\u2019\u201d said one."

They argued that we are inherently incapable of exhibiting honor, discipline, honesty, selflessness, and humility that is expected of service members.\n\nArguing that we shouldn't serve because we're mentally ill would still horrendous and incorrect, but they're arguing that we are *morally inferior and unfit* to serve. \n\nIt is *insane* that the SCOTUS rubber stamped this.",
