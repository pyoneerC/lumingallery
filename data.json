He took a future.\"\n\nThe child's mother, Hanan Shaheen, was the first to take the stand in the weeklong trial.\n\nShe said Czuba attacked her first with a knife, stabbing her multiple times, saying, \"You devil Muslim, you must die,\" as her son watched, according  to\u00a0WLS, which was in the courtroom.\n\nShe testified that she called 911 from the bathroom when he appeared to leave, but then she started to hear her son screaming, according to WLS.\n\n\"I started hearing my son screaming, screaming, screaming, 'Oh no, stop,'\" Shaheen said, according to WLS.\n\nJurors also listened to the mother's 911 call from the bathroom, in which she was heard telling the dispatcher, \"He's killing my baby,\" WLS reported.\n\nJurors additionally heard remarks Czuba made in a law enforcement vehicle following the attack.\n\n\"I thought they were going to do jihad on me,\" Czuba said, according to WLS.\n\nHe also said he was \"afraid for my life\" and his wife and said the family was \"just like infested rats,\" according to\u00a0WLS.",

A Republican known for his pragmatism, Ryan served as governor from 1999 to 2003. He gained international recognition for halting executions and commuting all death row sentences in Illinois, citing systemic injustices in the capital punishment system. However, his career was marred by a corruption scandal dating back to his tenure as secretary of state, leading to a 2006 conviction for racketeering, bribery, extortion, money laundering, and tax fraud. He served over five years in federal prison and was released in 2013.",

He took a life from us. He took a future.\"\n\nThe child's mother, Hanan Shaheen, was the first to take the stand in the weeklong trial.\n\nShe said Czuba attacked her first with a knife, stabbing her multiple times, saying, \"You devil Muslim, you must die,\" as her son watched, according  to\u00a0WLS, which was in the courtroom.\n\nShe testified that she called 911 from the bathroom when he appeared to leave, but then she started to hear her son screaming, according to WLS.\n\n\"I started hearing my son screaming, screaming, screaming, 'Oh no, stop,'\" Shaheen said, according to WLS.\n\nJurors also listened to the mother's 911 call from the bathroom, in which she was heard telling the dispatcher, \"He's killing my baby,\" WLS reported.\n\nJurors additionally heard remarks Czuba made in a law enforcement vehicle following the attack.\n\n\"I thought they were going to do jihad on me,\" Czuba said, according to WLS.\n\nHe also said he was \"afraid for my life\" and his wife and said the family was \"just like infested rats,\" according to\u00a0WLS.",

A Republican known for his pragmatism, Ryan served as governor from 1999 to 2003. He gained international recognition for halting executions and commuting all death row sentences in Illinois, citing systemic injustices in the capital punishment system. However, his career was marred by a corruption scandal dating back to his tenure as secretary of state, leading to a 2006 conviction for racketeering, bribery, extortion, money laundering, and tax fraud. He served over five years in federal prison and was released in 2013.",
