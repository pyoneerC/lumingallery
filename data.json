                "Of all the Republicans to draw inspiration from, why do these assholes keep going back to Nixon and McCarthy?",
                "The White House has lost confidence in a Pentagon leak investigation that\u00a0Pete Hegseth\u00a0used to justify firing three top aides last month, after advisers were told that the aides had supposedly been outed by an illegal warrantless National Security Agency (NSA) wiretap.\n\nThe extraordinary explanation alarmed the advisers, who also raised it with people close to\u00a0JD Vance, because such a wiretap would almost certainly be unconstitutional and an even bigger scandal than a number of leaks.\n\nBut the advisers found the claim to be untrue and complained that they were being fed dubious information by Hegseth\u2019s personal lawyer, Tim Parlatore, who had been tasked with overseeing the investigation.\n\nThe episode, as recounted by four people familiar with the matter, marked the most extraordinary twist in the investigation examining the leak of an allegedly top secret document that outlined options for the US military to reclaim the Panama canal to a reporter.\n\nThe advisers were stunned again when Parlatore denied having told anyone about an illegal NSA wiretap himself and maintained that any information he had was passed on to him by others at the Pentagon.\n\nThe leak was first attributed internally to Hegseth\u2019s senior adviser, Dan Caldwell, who was escorted out of the Pentagon and\u00a0fired last month alongside two other aides, Hegseth\u2019s former deputy chief of staff, Darin Selnick, and the deputy defense secretary\u2019s chief of staff Colin Carroll.\n\nBut the illegal wiretap claim and Caldwell\u2019s denials fueled a breakdown in trust between the Pentagon and the White House, where the Trump advisers tracking the investigation have privately suggested they no longer have any idea about who or what to believe.\n\nIn particular, one Trump adviser recently told Hegseth that he did not think Caldwell \u2013 or any of the fired aides \u2013 had leaked anything, and that he suspected the investigation had been used to get rid of aides involved in the infighting with his first chief of staff, Joe Kasper.\n\nThe fraught situation is sure to increase pressure on Hegseth ahead of a Senate hearing next month, and more broadly for his office, which has been\u00a0roiled by the leak investigation\u00a0that has now continued for nearly a month with no new evidence or referral to the FBI.\n\nThe fallout has left Hegseth with no chief or deputy chief of staff, as he relies on six senior advisers to run his front office, which is involved in setting the direction of the defense department that has a budget of nearly $1tn and oversees more than two million troops.\n\nAnd while Hegseth\u2019s former junior military aide Ricky Buria has effectively assumed the job of the chief of staff, the White House has blocked Hegseth from giving him the job permanently\u00a0on account of his limited experience and role in internal office drama.\n\nThe Pentagon declined to comment on reporting for this story. A spokesperson for the White House said in a statement: \u201cPresident Trump is confident in the secretary\u2019s ability to ensure top leadership at the Department of Defense shares their focus on restoring a military that is focused on readiness, lethality, and excellence.\u201d",

                "Of all the Republicans to draw inspiration from, why do these assholes keep going back to Nixon and McCarthy?",
                "The White House has lost confidence in a Pentagon leak investigation that\u00a0Pete Hegseth\u00a0used to justify firing three top aides last month, after advisers were told that the aides had supposedly been outed by an illegal warrantless National Security Agency (NSA) wiretap.\n\nThe extraordinary explanation alarmed the advisers, who also raised it with people close to\u00a0JD Vance, because such a wiretap would almost certainly be unconstitutional and an even bigger scandal than a number of leaks.\n\nBut the advisers found the claim to be untrue and complained that they were being fed dubious information by Hegseth\u2019s personal lawyer, Tim Parlatore, who had been tasked with overseeing the investigation.\n\nThe episode, as recounted by four people familiar with the matter, marked the most extraordinary twist in the investigation examining the leak of an allegedly top secret document that outlined options for the US military to reclaim the Panama canal to a reporter.\n\nThe advisers were stunned again when Parlatore denied having told anyone about an illegal NSA wiretap himself and maintained that any information he had was passed on to him by others at the Pentagon.\n\nThe leak was first attributed internally to Hegseth\u2019s senior adviser, Dan Caldwell, who was escorted out of the Pentagon and\u00a0fired last month alongside two other aides, Hegseth\u2019s former deputy chief of staff, Darin Selnick, and the deputy defense secretary\u2019s chief of staff Colin Carroll.\n\nBut the illegal wiretap claim and Caldwell\u2019s denials fueled a breakdown in trust between the Pentagon and the White House, where the Trump advisers tracking the investigation have privately suggested they no longer have any idea about who or what to believe.\n\nIn particular, one Trump adviser recently told Hegseth that he did not think Caldwell \u2013 or any of the fired aides \u2013 had leaked anything, and that he suspected the investigation had been used to get rid of aides involved in the infighting with his first chief of staff, Joe Kasper.\n\nThe fraught situation is sure to increase pressure on Hegseth ahead of a Senate hearing next month, and more broadly for his office, which has been\u00a0roiled by the leak investigation\u00a0that has now continued for nearly a month with no new evidence or referral to the FBI.\n\nThe fallout has left Hegseth with no chief or deputy chief of staff, as he relies on six senior advisers to run his front office, which is involved in setting the direction of the defense department that has a budget of nearly $1tn and oversees more than two million troops.\n\nAnd while Hegseth\u2019s former junior military aide Ricky Buria has effectively assumed the job of the chief of staff, the White House has blocked Hegseth from giving him the job permanently\u00a0on account of his limited experience and role in internal office drama.\n\nThe Pentagon declined to comment on reporting for this story. A spokesperson for the White House said in a statement: \u201cPresident Trump is confident in the secretary\u2019s ability to ensure top leadership at the Department of Defense shares their focus on restoring a military that is focused on readiness, lethality, and excellence.\u201d",

I wonder what the reasoning was for that particular number.\n\nRegardless, it's a good idea to require more stringent control to prevent children from accessing porn - I just don't know what method would be accepted. It does not look like the article gives examples of what would be accepted. I think entering credit card details has been banded about as an idea before, but not sure how effective that would be either.

At worst, you might need to click \"I am 18+\" before you can follow a link. That does feel irresponsible in regards to protecting children. \n\nI think a big part of the problem is there is so much free porn now and that includes weird shit. I have a hard time understanding why anyone even pays for porn. But in the earlier days of the internet, it was hard to see any porn online simply because everyone charged. They locked it down not to protect children, but to force you to pay. Maybe the solution is to charge $1 for access and the paywall is what keeps children out.\n\nETA: missing word"

                "Of all the Republicans to draw inspiration from, why do these assholes keep going back to Nixon and McCarthy?",
                "The White House has lost confidence in a Pentagon leak investigation that\u00a0Pete Hegseth\u00a0used to justify firing three top aides last month, after advisers were told that the aides had supposedly been outed by an illegal warrantless National Security Agency (NSA) wiretap.\n\nThe extraordinary explanation alarmed the advisers, who also raised it with people close to\u00a0JD Vance, because such a wiretap would almost certainly be unconstitutional and an even bigger scandal than a number of leaks.\n\nBut the advisers found the claim to be untrue and complained that they were being fed dubious information by Hegseth\u2019s personal lawyer, Tim Parlatore, who had been tasked with overseeing the investigation.\n\nThe episode, as recounted by four people familiar with the matter, marked the most extraordinary twist in the investigation examining the leak of an allegedly top secret document that outlined options for the US military to reclaim the Panama canal to a reporter.\n\nThe advisers were stunned again when Parlatore denied having told anyone about an illegal NSA wiretap himself and maintained that any information he had was passed on to him by others at the Pentagon.\n\nThe leak was first attributed internally to Hegseth\u2019s senior adviser, Dan Caldwell, who was escorted out of the Pentagon and\u00a0fired last month alongside two other aides, Hegseth\u2019s former deputy chief of staff, Darin Selnick, and the deputy defense secretary\u2019s chief of staff Colin Carroll.\n\nBut the illegal wiretap claim and Caldwell\u2019s denials fueled a breakdown in trust between the Pentagon and the White House, where the Trump advisers tracking the investigation have privately suggested they no longer have any idea about who or what to believe.\n\nIn particular, one Trump adviser recently told Hegseth that he did not think Caldwell \u2013 or any of the fired aides \u2013 had leaked anything, and that he suspected the investigation had been used to get rid of aides involved in the infighting with his first chief of staff, Joe Kasper.\n\nThe fraught situation is sure to increase pressure on Hegseth ahead of a Senate hearing next month, and more broadly for his office, which has been\u00a0roiled by the leak investigation\u00a0that has now continued for nearly a month with no new evidence or referral to the FBI.\n\nThe fallout has left Hegseth with no chief or deputy chief of staff, as he relies on six senior advisers to run his front office, which is involved in setting the direction of the defense department that has a budget of nearly $1tn and oversees more than two million troops.\n\nAnd while Hegseth\u2019s former junior military aide Ricky Buria has effectively assumed the job of the chief of staff, the White House has blocked Hegseth from giving him the job permanently\u00a0on account of his limited experience and role in internal office drama.\n\nThe Pentagon declined to comment on reporting for this story. A spokesperson for the White House said in a statement: \u201cPresident Trump is confident in the secretary\u2019s ability to ensure top leadership at the Department of Defense shares their focus on restoring a military that is focused on readiness, lethality, and excellence.\u201d",

                "If teens want to find porn they will find porn. You don't even need to access adult orientated sites to find it. I honestly don't see the point of this. The time and money wasted here is better spent teaching kids how to use the internet safely and responsibly.",
                ">European Commission alleges the verification systems are ineffective to prevent under-18s from watching\n\nYeah, and??  That's not their job; that's the parents' job.  Car manufacturers aren't responsible for ensuring that toddlers don't play in traffic; they give the cars adequate brakes to try to prevent tragedy when possible but there's only so much they can do.  It's parents who need to make sure their kids don't end up playing somewhere dangerous, why should that be any different when it's online? \n\nBecause the only way to prevent toddlers from playing in the streets without giving any of that responsibility to the parents is to install a toddler fence on the side of every road, which would also impede *adults'* ability to access the road.  *This is exactly the same issue*.",

Every time they want a law to gather more data it's either children or terrorists, are you for that? You have nothing to hide, right?\n\nI'm sorry I'm sceptic",

Teenagers nowadays can definitely find whatever they want with the press of a few buttons.\n\nIt's inevitable.\n\n\nI still remember when I figured out I could type in boobs in Google.\n\nWhat are you gonna do? Ban search engines?",
                "> Under the DSA, the commission regulates platforms with more than 45 million users, such as Google, Meta and X, while national authorities in the 27 member states are responsible for those below this threshold.\n\nThat feels like an oddly specific number of users to set as the threshold. I wonder what the reasoning was for that particular number.\n\nRegardless, it's a good idea to require more stringent control to prevent children from accessing porn - I just don't know what method would be accepted. It does not look like the article gives examples of what would be accepted. I think entering credit card details has been banded about as an idea before, but not sure how effective that would be either. I suspect that whatever method is brought in, people would find a way to work around.",
                "As concerned as I am about restricting what we can see on the internet (it's a slippery slope), you have to admit it is a little crazy that you can Google the word \"porn\", switch to videos, turn off safe search and have unlimited results. At worst, you might need to click \"I am 18+\" before you can follow a link. That does feel irresponsible in regards to protecting children. \n\nI think a big part of the problem is there is so much free porn now and that includes weird shit. I have a hard time understanding why anyone even pays for porn. But in the earlier days of the internet, it was hard to see any porn online simply because everyone charged. They locked it down not to protect children, but to force you to pay. Maybe the solution is to charge $1 for access and the paywall is what keeps children out.\n\nETA: missing word"
