Just keep your mouth shut or have a lawyer talk for you. \n\nAlso, the gun thing seems irrelevant. Unless these people are convicted felons, I dont think its illegal to give them access to firearms.

He said the first time he heard that they may have gang ties was the morning federal agents raided their home took the men into custody.\n\nCano said he and his wife, Nancy Cano allowed the men to stay in their spare studio apartment in April 2024.
