                "A smart lawyer should be able to get both citations dismissed before the court date. If the unusual plate is what caused the officer to begin tailing in the hope of a citation then they tacked on the speeding it may be fruit-of-the-poison-tree. If the other way around & there was an assumption of lenience on the speed except that the officer did not know how to record then it might be just dismissed."
