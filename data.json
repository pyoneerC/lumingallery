The Guti\u00e9rrez family says it has been left without information or answers.\n\n>The teen was detained alongside 237 other Venezuelans on 24 February by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). His father, Wilmer Guti\u00e9rrez, told Documented: \u201cI feel like my son was kidnapped.\n\n>\u201cI\u2019ve spent countless hours searching for him, going from one precinct to another, speaking with numerous people who kept referring me elsewhere. Yet, after all this, no one has given me any information or provided a single document about his case.\u201d\n\n>The elder Guti\u00e9rrez reportedly said he overheard Ice agents saying that his son had not been the person they had come to get.\n\n>**The officers grabbed him and two other boys right at the entrance to our building. One said: \u2018No, he\u2019s not the one,\u2019 like they were looking for someone else. But the other said: \u2018Take him anyway,\u2019\u201d he recalled.**\n\n>**Guti\u00e9rrez has no criminal record either in Venezuela or the US, his family said. He also did not have any tattoos** which is a feature that US law enforcement often use to link people to the Tren de Aragua gang \u2013 a transnational criminal organization from Venezuela \u2013 and to justify their expulsions from the country.\n\n>**Despite this, Guti\u00e9rrez was arrested and later deported to El Salvador, to which he has no ties.**\n\n>Wilmer Guti\u00e9rrez says he discovered through a news report that his son had been deported to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. He watched videos on social media that showed detainees facing harsh conditions, such as having their heads shaved by authorities and being marched to their prison cells.\n\n>\u201dI could have understood if he\u2019d been sent back to Venezuela,\u201d he said. \u201cBut why to a foreign country he\u2019s never even been to?\u201d\n\n>The Guti\u00e9rrez family\u2019s reported ordeal comes after the Trump administration admitted to wrongly deporting a Maryland man, Kilmar Abrego Garc\u00eda, to the same Cecot facility.\n\n>The president of El Salvador said in a meeting with Trump on Monday that the Salvadoran government would not order the return of Abrego Garc\u00eda to the US.\n\n>Monday\u2019s meeting at the White House came amid a broader push by the Trump administration to remove noncitizens from the US, including people who are here legally and have not been charged with crimes.\n\n>Trump has also openly stated that he would like to remove US citizens who commit unspecified violent crimes and send them to the same Salvadoran prison as Abrego Garc\u00eda and Guti\u00e9rrez.",

It's a long read, but the source is from NPR.  \"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/15/nx-s1-5355896/doge-nlrb-elon-musk-spacex-security",
                "DOGE is the cyber breach...",
                "> The NLRB, a New Deal-era agency that is tasked with protecting workers' rights to organize and join unions, has for years been a target of America's corporate titans, including Musk, some of whom are now seeking to have the agency's powers declared unconstitutional.\n\n>In an affidavit, Berulis said he had evidence that DOGE staffers were given extraordinarily sweeping access to the NLRB's systems, including to sensitive case files. He said that beginning in early March, logging protocols created to audit users appeared to have been tampered with, and that he had detected the removal of about 10 gigabytes worth of data from NLRB's network sometime thereafter.\n\n> That kind of spike is extremely unusual because data almost never directly leaves NLRB's databases,\" Berulis said in his affidavit.\nA spokesperson for Musk's team - officially known as U.S. DOGE Service - didn't immediately return a message seeking comment. A message left with the NLRB also wasn't immediately returned, although NPR, which first reported the story, opens new tab, quoted an NLRB spokesperson as disputing Berulis' claims and saying there had been no breach. Cotton and Warner didn't immediately return messages seeking comment.\n\n> NPR, which said it interviewed 30 sources in government, law enforcement, the cybersecurity industry, and the labor movement about the complaint, said that the disabling of logging software was reminiscent of cybercriminal behavior.\n\n>Berulis' affidavit said that an effort by him and his colleague to formally investigate and alert the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) was disrupted by higher-ups without explanation. A message left with CISA wasn't immediately returned.",
                "I heard about this on NPR. What NPR reported but is not included in this article, is that they detected remote logins using legitimate usernames and passwords, but originating from a Russian IP address. So not only is DOGE removing information, but they\u2019ve given remote access to Russia. 99.9999999% chance this isn\u2019t the only agency they now have access to.\n\nEdit:  it is in the article. I missed it.",
                "Quote from the legal document presented by the NLRB's lawyers\n\n\n>This declaration details DOGE activity within NLRB, the exfiltration of data fromNLRB systems, and \u2013 concerningly \u2013 near real-time access by users in Russia.\u00a0\n\n\n>Notably,within minutes of DOGE personnel creating user accounts in NLRB systems, onmultiple occasions someone or something within Russia attempted to login using all ofthe valid credentials (eg. Usernames/Passwords).\n\n\nHoly fuck. Sends chills down my spine. They are really russian assests that have infilitrated the highest levels of The U.S. government.\n\n\nBlood will spill over all of this shit",
                "Whichever departments are still untouched should probably get going on independent backups of their data.",
                "I can only imagine what DOGE would be doing at the NLRB\u2026 oh wait, targeting union organizers. \n\nIt is happening.",
                "Yeah, everyone in tech knew this was a disaster both happening and in the making.\n\nWhat can you do though, when the population elects a disaster?\n\nYou just have to wait for it to play out, while knowing their denial means they'll never even accept they created the disaster.",
                "DOGE itself is the cyber breach. Anything else is just additional damage."

                "Edit your headline:\n\n\"Two Service Members Lives Wasted on Needless Political Spectacle\"\n\n  \nAccidents happen. Accidents happen all too often when you place young men & women in situations where they are tasked with operating heavy equipment and machinery while overburdened, fatigued, in austere conditions. A military life is not always a safe life. They weren't drafted, they volunteered, but that's no reason to exploit their commitment to service by placing them in an environment that makes accidents like this more likely. \n\nMake no mistake, the entire Border mission is a political show to appease the current administration. The US Army is not trained to conduct these operations, nor is it part of their roles as defined in current military doctrine. Border security is the responsibility of Customs and Border Patrol - something this government continues to fail to remember. If CBP is unable to perform their duties, it should NOT fall upon the Armed Forces to pick up their slack. A Stryker (like the one depicted in the photo attached to this article) is overkill and wasteful for the role assigned, which would be under normal circumstances be performed by a CBP officer in a CBP Ford Expedition or similar SUV. Which perfectly encapsulates the overwrought optics of this whole sideshow.\n\nTwo Americans died, needlessly, in a situation they should never have been in. Contact your Representatives.\n\n\\- A Retired Officer",
                "One time, I was camping near the border, driving along a two track road that was frequented by military and border patrol agents. I saw a truck approach from the opposite direction, and pulled as far to the side as I could to let them pass.\u00a0\n\nThey proceeded to run full speed into an ironwood tree, completely wrecking their nice, new truck. I pulled past them, and, kind of in disbelief, asked the driver if they were okay. A man in military fatigues, who looked like he had been up for days on Bang! Energy or experimental military-grade amphetamines, said to me, \u201cthat\u2019ll buff right out\u201d.\u00a0\n\nI wonder if this accident was something like that.\u00a0"

It was pure extortion. I realize they did the math and made a business decision, but you can't trust Trump to honor his word.

It was pure extortion. I realize they did the math and made a business decision, but you can't trust Trump to honor his word. And do they even know what \"causes supported by the president\" means?\n\nThe same thing is going to ultimately screw us on trade. How do you make a deal when you can't trust the other party and they also won't follow decisions by the courts? What recourse do you have when the market changes and Trump says the deal needs to be renegotiated 3 months from now?",
