Hamas releasing the hostages won't end the war (nor does it seem a priority for the Israeli government) and there will never be a full Hamas surrender. In fact with 40,000+ civilians killed they've likely  created more militants that hate Israel than they had before the war began. You don't create peace through death and destruction of civilian populations.\n\nIsrael need to create a better alternative to Hamas, because currently it's a choice between the terrorists of Hamas or the people killing your family and friends and a lot of them are going to pick the first option if no reasonable alternative exists.
