To whit:\n\n1.) A software update meant to improve the positional accuracy of the map bricked - get this - the A/C system. In the summer. It was literally a guessing game whether the A/C would turn on when I got in the car. Persisted for about 3 months before a patch was rolled out.\n\n2.) The vaunted heat pump quit twice, once in winter (as we were moving across the country). Only a threat of litigation got the service center to replace the unit. Replacing it took the service center nearly a week.\n\n3.) A simple windshield replacement was needed after a rock caused a crack that started spreading. I scheduled service (soonest I could get a spot was 4 weeks out) which got delayed an additional whole month because \u201cOur glass guy is sick,\u201d and yet another whole month because \u201cWe don\u2019t have glass.\u201d\n\n4.) At 4 years of ownership, it was found that elements of the sub-frame were developing soon-to-be catastrophic cracks. No, I didn\u2019t rally race it. Yes, I was religious about washing road salt off of it in wintertime. The upper control arm bushing was also \u201cshredded\u201d according to Firestone.\n\nAfter #4 happened, I drove to a dealership that literal same day and traded it in.",

Over time, I\u2019ve learned that I thrive as a second-in-command, not as a leader.

It was a fun, engaging car and whoo boy that acceleration was bonkers.\n\nThen the reality set in. I kept trying to push through the inconveniences but damned if they didn\u2019t add up quickly. To whit:\n\n1.) A software update meant to improve the positional accuracy of the map bricked - get this - the A/C system. In the summer. It was literally a guessing game whether the A/C would turn on when I got in the car. Persisted for about 3 months before a patch was rolled out.\n\n2.) The vaunted heat pump quit twice, once in winter (as we were moving across the country). Only a threat of litigation got the service center to replace the unit. Replacing it took the service center nearly a week.\n\n3.) A simple windshield replacement was needed after a rock caused a crack that started spreading. I scheduled service (soonest I could get a spot was 4 weeks out) which got delayed an additional whole month because \u201cOur glass guy is sick,\u201d and yet another whole month because \u201cWe don\u2019t have glass.\u201d\n\n4.) At 4 years of ownership, it was found that elements of the sub-frame were developing soon-to-be catastrophic cracks. No, I didn\u2019t rally race it. Yes, I was religious about washing road salt off of it in wintertime. The upper control arm bushing was also \u201cshredded\u201d according to Firestone.\n\nAfter #4 happened, I drove to a dealership that literal same day and traded it in.",

I thought I understood where he was coming from. In many ways, I\u2019m brilliant, but in others, painfully unaware. Enough people have told me that my particular quirks can rub others the wrong way. Over time, I\u2019ve learned that I thrive as a second-in-command, not as a leader. And I\u2019ve come to accept that I should avoid making public statements.\n\nI was seriously considering buying a Tesla. That\u2019s no longer on the table.
