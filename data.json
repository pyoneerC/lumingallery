A few months later Ford moved more jobs to mexico.   \n   \nOf course they aren\u2019t going to build plants in the US.

                "I used to work supplying automotive and their supply networks are vast and complicated. Even if they move the plants to the US (which is costly and there's good economic reason they have plants in Canada and Mexico) they'd then have to entirely rebuild their supply networks to get all the parts and materials they need. It's impossible to divorce the US auto industry from the Canadian and Mexican auto industries.\u00a0",
                "They can\u2019t move manufacturing overnight, and they definitely won\u2019t be moving it as long as we keep having these month to month tariff adjustments. As long as these companies don\u2019t know what the tariff situation is going to look like in the long term, they\u2019re just going to pay the import tax and raise prices.\n\nIf you want to move manufacturing back to the US the best way would be to announce tariffs that are set to take effect in 6 months to a year, and in the meantime give a strong incentive (likely through some kind of tax break or rebate) to open manufacturing facilities in the US, and offer another tax break for consumers who purchase cars manufactured in the US. Companies would be more inclined to relocate plants if they know what the future looks like, and if it looks like future profits would benefit from manufacturing in the US.",
                "The ironic thing is all the Euro, Japanese, and Korean plants are in the US for the US market but the domestic brands outsource. If you want to buy made in America, don\u2019t buy an American car brand.",
                "Leave factories where they are, pass on tariff costs to customers. Then (if it would be cheaper for you) move factories into the US to eliminate the tariff impact, but leave the tariff pricing customers are now used to in place. Profit.",

I\u2019ve heard so much about how dangerous I-35 can be, and it makes me wonder if better road design, stricter speed enforcement, or improved public transit could help prevent tragedies like this. My heart goes out to the families affected, no one should have to experience such a loss.",
