                "Trump wants to expand the USA and yet they can\u2019t provide electricity to a USA territory? What kind of banana republic the USA is becoming",
                "San Juan, Puerto Rico (AP) \u2014 An island-wide blackout hit Puerto Rico on Wednesday as the largely Catholic residents of the U.S. territory prepared to celebrate the Easter weekend, officials said.\n\nAll 1.4 million clients on the island were without power, Hugo Sorrentini, spokesman for Luma Energy, which oversees the transmission and distribution of power, told The Associated Press. \u201cThe entire island is without generation,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, at least 78,000 clients were without water, with officials warning that power likely won\u2019t be fully restored for another 48 to 72 hours.",

                "And they don't have an obvious reason? Going to be a stressful couple days. People were probably doing a lot of food prep at the very least, too.",
                "I just had a call with my parents and at least for now they have cell signal but water was starting to go out already.  They have solar so gas is no issue for them BUT gas stations already have hour long lines since it caught folks off guard during the regular rush hour",
                "Puerto Rico built up a robust electrical grid that was owned by the public but was sold off to a business to be \u201cmore efficient\u201d.\u00a0After it was privatized prices increased while the quality went down drastically. This situation sucks and happens all the time.",
                "Major infrastructure (hotels, airport, some markets/restaurants) have sufficient generators to keep going but there's definitely a shift here",
                "So what's the roof top solar panel industry like down there?",
                "What did Puerto Rico say that Trump didn\u2019t like?",
                "Such a giant shit hole"
