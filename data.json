In the US kids (and adults) with short bowel syndrome can receive these infusions at home and then go to school or work, generally being contributing members to their communities. In many other countries these people live at the hospital, forever. Home infusions are not an option. They cannot work. Can't go to school. Just survive. It's really fucking sad."
