Tax incentives need to be granted for builders of less expensive, and more modest homes and multifamily buildings. Limits need to be placed on businesses and individuals who own multiple properties.

Tax incentives need to be granted for builders of less expensive, and more modest homes and multifamily buildings. Limits need to be placed on businesses and individuals who own multiple properties.
