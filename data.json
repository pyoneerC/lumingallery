The only info I can find refers to \"sober living homes,\" halfway houses, or debt recovery businesses. Even the 2024 Florida Statutes governing \"recovery residences\" refers to substance abuse and addiction and says nothing about procedures such plastic surgery.\n\nOne would think something like this would be covered by licensing requirements, but we are talking Florida here after all.",

Not everyone who has surgery has a support network to care for them and hospitals will not perform surgery unless you can be discharged into someone\u2019s care. So while it is true these \u201crecovery houses\u201d often care for plastic surgery patients, I\u2019ve seen them used by folks who needed non-elective surgeries. And no, you can\u2019t just call an uber driver to take you home because you have to be discharged with someone who can actually take care of you post-op. \n\nThere\u2019s minimal regulations and this is going to be another case where the new regulations are written in blood.",

I cringe at the stories my mother tells me about scam services she has purchased. People are constantly coming to her door to pressure her to let them do something to her house.\n\nAnd that is just in person. Don't get me started with online stuff she does. I told her if there is ANY doubt, assume it is a scam. Or check with one of us 'kids' first. Companies like Amazon and Microsoft don't give a shit about you and will not proactively contact you about any problem. And anytime you hear 'gift card', it is automatically a scam. Why would one of your friends want you to purchase a dozen gift cards, reveal the codes, take a picture and send it to them? It makes no sense. She was about 10 minutes away from doing it before her friend called her to say her email account was hacked.",
