                "The US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, said on Wednesday that he had directed the FDA to review the regulations around the abortion pill mifepristone.\n\nThe review, he said, was necessary due to \u201cnew data\u201d \u2013 data that emerged from a flawed analysis that top US anti-abortion groups are now using to pressure the Trump administration to reimpose restrictions on the abortion pill, if not pull it from the market entirely.\n\n...**The analysis, which has not been peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal**, came after the Food and Drug Administration commissioner said he was open to reviewing new safety data on the pills, which are used in nearly two-thirds of abortions nationwide.\n\nThe conservative organizations are rallying behind a paper published on 28 April by a rightwing thinktank, the Ethics and Public Policy Center, which claims there are higher complication rates from taking mifepristone than previously known.\n\nThe paper has attracted scrutiny for appearing to dramatically overstate what it characterizes as \u201cserious adverse effects\u201d associated with the pill, according to medical experts. For example, it counts ectopic pregnancies \u2013 when an embryo implants somewhere other than the uterine lining \u2013 as a serious complication.\n\nMifepristone does not cause an ectopic pregnancy and taking it will not harm someone with an ectopic. It also claims that needing an in-clinic procedure to complete the abortion is a complication, when patients are counseled in advance about the pills\u2019 failure rate of about 3 to 4%.\n\n**The data, the authors say, means the FDA should reinstate earlier restrictions on mifepristone, including a ban on telemedicine and limiting use to the first seven weeks of pregnancy \u2013 but they do not intend to stop there.**\n\nThe authors note that restoring the limits could lead to better monitoring that could help \u201cdetermine whether this drug should remain on the market\u201d, statements that echo proposals found in Project 2025, the 900-page playbook published by the Heritage Foundation and for which the EPPC was an advisory board member.\n\n**Project 2025 calls to end telemedicine prescriptions of abortion pills as an \u201cinterim step\u201d to revoking mifepristone\u2019s approval altogether.**\n\nMore than 100 scientific studies have found the medications cited in the paper are safe and effective for ending a pregnancy.",

It's a state university who is seeing a demographic that they don't think will latent their college alongside a trend they think is going to rock PA and shrinking itself now so it doesn't embarrass itself later. I don't know the state of PA so I don't know how this affects those closing campuses but I do feel that it's better to close than to occupy at limited capacity just to state that you're still open.

                "The US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, said on Wednesday that he had directed the FDA to review the regulations around the abortion pill mifepristone.\n\nThe review, he said, was necessary due to \u201cnew data\u201d \u2013 data that emerged from a flawed analysis that top US anti-abortion groups are now using to pressure the Trump administration to reimpose restrictions on the abortion pill, if not pull it from the market entirely.\n\n...**The analysis, which has not been peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal**, came after the Food and Drug Administration commissioner said he was open to reviewing new safety data on the pills, which are used in nearly two-thirds of abortions nationwide.\n\nThe conservative organizations are rallying behind a paper published on 28 April by a rightwing thinktank, the Ethics and Public Policy Center, which claims there are higher complication rates from taking mifepristone than previously known.\n\nThe paper has attracted scrutiny for appearing to dramatically overstate what it characterizes as \u201cserious adverse effects\u201d associated with the pill, according to medical experts. For example, it counts ectopic pregnancies \u2013 when an embryo implants somewhere other than the uterine lining \u2013 as a serious complication.\n\nMifepristone does not cause an ectopic pregnancy and taking it will not harm someone with an ectopic. It also claims that needing an in-clinic procedure to complete the abortion is a complication, when patients are counseled in advance about the pills\u2019 failure rate of about 3 to 4%.\n\n**The data, the authors say, means the FDA should reinstate earlier restrictions on mifepristone, including a ban on telemedicine and limiting use to the first seven weeks of pregnancy \u2013 but they do not intend to stop there.**\n\nThe authors note that restoring the limits could lead to better monitoring that could help \u201cdetermine whether this drug should remain on the market\u201d, statements that echo proposals found in Project 2025, the 900-page playbook published by the Heritage Foundation and for which the EPPC was an advisory board member.\n\n**Project 2025 calls to end telemedicine prescriptions of abortion pills as an \u201cinterim step\u201d to revoking mifepristone\u2019s approval altogether.**\n\nMore than 100 scientific studies have found the medications cited in the paper are safe and effective for ending a pregnancy.",

I\u2019m grateful to have had it.\n\nThey\u2019re right though about the demographics. I left PA because there was so little there as an adult. It never fully recovered (in my area) after coal dried up and then 08 hit. My county was old even when I was young. \n\nIt\u2019ll always be home, but I didn\u2019t have it in me to stay.",
                "Almost no one here read the article or understands what it really means. Penn State is closing branch campuses, which cater almost entirely to local populations. No one from out of state dreams of going to Penn State Shenango on the border of Ohio, which is over an hour from any major population center. No one is moving to Sharon PA either. The population peaked in the 50's and is half of what it was then. It is #197 of cities by population in PA. Sure Penn States tuition is bonkers, blah blah.

Forty-one of Pennsylvania\u2019s 67 counties are facing significant population declines: rural counties are projected to lose 5.8% of their total population by 2050, while urban counties are projected to grow slightly (+4.1%),\u201d the report states.\n\nYea, this isn't a joking matter. It's a state university who is seeing a demographic that they don't think will latent their college alongside a trend they think is going to rock PA and shrinking itself now so it doesn't embarrass itself later. I don't know the state of PA so I don't know how this affects those closing campuses but I do feel that it's better to close than to occupy at limited capacity just to state that you're still open. I bet this also means that unless something magical happens tuition will also unfortunately increase as more students will funnel into their other campuses which will potentially stress resources \n\nAwful all around but better to do now than later",

                "Meanwhile at Penn State\u2018s main campus, they are aiming to increase enrollment by thousands of students, but the local borough passed a zoning ordinance effectively banning most off-campus apartments from the core of downtown.\n\nTo nobody\u2019s surprise, housing is becoming crushingly unaffordable there. I\u2019m sure the landlords on the Planning Commission are more than happy about that!\n\nWe\u2019re going to see much more of this \u201cfeast or famine\u201d in higher education over the next couple decades, and it\u2019s going to get ugly."

                "The US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, said on Wednesday that he had directed the FDA to review the regulations around the abortion pill mifepristone.\n\nThe review, he said, was necessary due to \u201cnew data\u201d \u2013 data that emerged from a flawed analysis that top US anti-abortion groups are now using to pressure the Trump administration to reimpose restrictions on the abortion pill, if not pull it from the market entirely.\n\n...**The analysis, which has not been peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal**, came after the Food and Drug Administration commissioner said he was open to reviewing new safety data on the pills, which are used in nearly two-thirds of abortions nationwide.\n\nThe conservative organizations are rallying behind a paper published on 28 April by a rightwing thinktank, the Ethics and Public Policy Center, which claims there are higher complication rates from taking mifepristone than previously known.\n\nThe paper has attracted scrutiny for appearing to dramatically overstate what it characterizes as \u201cserious adverse effects\u201d associated with the pill, according to medical experts. For example, it counts ectopic pregnancies \u2013 when an embryo implants somewhere other than the uterine lining \u2013 as a serious complication.\n\nMifepristone does not cause an ectopic pregnancy and taking it will not harm someone with an ectopic. It also claims that needing an in-clinic procedure to complete the abortion is a complication, when patients are counseled in advance about the pills\u2019 failure rate of about 3 to 4%.\n\n**The data, the authors say, means the FDA should reinstate earlier restrictions on mifepristone, including a ban on telemedicine and limiting use to the first seven weeks of pregnancy \u2013 but they do not intend to stop there.**\n\nThe authors note that restoring the limits could lead to better monitoring that could help \u201cdetermine whether this drug should remain on the market\u201d, statements that echo proposals found in Project 2025, the 900-page playbook published by the Heritage Foundation and for which the EPPC was an advisory board member.\n\n**Project 2025 calls to end telemedicine prescriptions of abortion pills as an \u201cinterim step\u201d to revoking mifepristone\u2019s approval altogether.**\n\nMore than 100 scientific studies have found the medications cited in the paper are safe and effective for ending a pregnancy.",

I don't know the state of PA so I don't know how this affects those closing campuses but I do feel that it's better to close than to occupy at limited capacity just to state that you're still open.
