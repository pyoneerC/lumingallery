                "News snippet:\n\u201cHONOLULU (AP) \u2014 An Oregon man who quit his job at a tire company and liquidated his retirement savings to set sail for Hawaii with his cat, Phoenix, reached his destination Saturday, welcomed by cheering fans at the end of a weekslong journey that he documented for his mass of followers on social media.\n\nOliver Widger, who also was greeted by Hawaii Gov. Josh Green at the Waikiki Yacht Club on Oahu, acknowledged he was nervous facing the crowd, which included reporters. Widger said he was feeling \u201creally weird\u201d \u2014 not seasick, but, \u201cI just feel like I have to, like, hold on to things to not fall over.\u201d\nHe became an online sensation with his story, which followed a diagnosis four years ago with a syndrome that carried a risk of paralysis and made him realize he disliked his managerial job. He quit his job with \u201cno money, no plan\u201d and $10,000 of debt \u2014 and the goal of buying a sailboat and sailing around the world. \n\nHe taught himself to sail mostly via YouTube and moved from Portland to the Oregon coast. He spent months refitting the $50,000 boat he bought.\n\nHe set sail for Hawaii with Phoenix in late April, documenting their experiences for his more than 1 million followers on TikTok and 1.7 million followers on Instagram. He said he thinks his story, which made national news, resonated with people. \n\u201cI think a lot of people are, you know, you\u2019re grinding at your job all day long and it doesn\u2019t really matter how much money you make at this point, everybody\u2019s just trying to do enough to get by and that just wears you out,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the world\u2019s in a weird place, and I think people have seen that it\u2019s possible to break.",
                "I could not begin to imagine the juxtaposition of being totally solitary (all due respect to Phoenix the cat) for weeks, and then to arrive to a big crowd gathered for just you to socialize. I suppose it\u2019s a different kind of \u201csolitary\u201d when he\u2019s locked into social media, but still has to be night and day.\u00a0\n\nThe magnitude of accomplishment isn\u2019t the same, but I believe he and Charles Lindbergh could see eye to eye on what that feeling was like.\u00a0",
                "I'm bummed the journey is over, but I'm glad I got to see it! It was really cool to watch him pull off his dream in real(ish) time.",

                "I'm glad he made it.  Wasn't terribly worried, the weather had been nice and he had constant communications.  But still, things happen at sea.\n\nMakes me think of Steve and Alix over in Massachusetts, with their massive multi-year project to build a sail ship called *Arabella* and start taking her around the world.  When she got put in the water for the first time it was a huge deal.",
                "I wonder how he went from quitting his job being $10k in debt, to buying a $60k sailboat? Maybe took a loan? Just curious."

I seem to recall several outages where they found bullet holes.\n\n\nDepartment of Energy data suggests suspicious energy grid disruptions are on the rise, especially in the Western U.S.,\u00a0historically a white supremacist stronghold. In reports filed to the DOE, power grid operators identified 200 instances of vandalism, suspicious activity, sabotage or physical attacks in 2023, comprising 58% of all reported incidents. (Other reports cited factors like severe weather, cyberattacks or equipment failures.) That represents a large increase over the last five years. In 2017, just 9.3% of reported disturbances noted suspicious circumstances, a number that rises to 20-to-30% from 2018 to 2021. Over the past decade, roughly half of these attacks happened in the West.\u00a0\n\nThe FBI made arrests in three different white supremacist plots involving substations, all interrupted in 2020. In one case, three men who met through a neo-Nazi chat room planned to shoot up substations to take down the national energy grid. They were caught only because a man the group was recruiting lost his phone; the person who found it found Nazi propaganda on it and turned it over to the police. In the government\u2019s sentencing memorandum for one of the men, prosecutors said they \u201cplanned to attack substations with powerful rifles that would penetrate the transformers\u201d because they believed it would \u201ccause confusion and unrest\u201d and cost the government millions. \u201cThere was even discussion that their plan could succeed in producing a race war and the next Great Depression,\u201d the memo says. All three pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to provide material support to terrorists; one still awaits sentencing, and the\u00a0other two\u00a0are serving five- and seven-year prison terms.\n\nAnother three men were arrested at a Las Vegas Black Lives Matter protest with Molotov cocktails in their car, according to a Department of Justice\u00a0statement. The government alleges that the men, who claimed to be members of the far-right \u201cBoogaloo\u201d movement, had also plotted to firebomb a substation. Two pled guilty and were sentenced to between four and 20 years, while a third received life in prison.\n\nThe FBI also charged four men in another 2020 plot that involved conspiring to destroy an energy facility, as well as stealing military gear to carry out the attack. Two of them pleaded guilty; the other two pleaded not guilty and are still awaiting trial. Court documents allege that two of the co-conspirators met online in a neo-Nazi forum and recruited others, and the group shared photos of themselves giving the Nazi \u201cSieg Heil\u201d salute. In a detention hearing for one of the accused, Chris Little, a special agent for the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), testified that one of the men had compiled a list of assassination targets associated with the Black Lives Matter movement. Little testified that the person also handwrote a list of intersections in cities across the West, including Boise, Portland, Seattle and San Francisco. Every intersection contained energy infrastructure.\u00a0\n\nThe men, Little testified, wanted to create an outage because it \u201cdiverts the police, causes chaos from the outage itself, causes damage to the equipment, takes a long time to replace and causes an outage of significant length.\u201d They planned to use that chaos \u201cto create a favorable operating environment to conduct an assassination.\u201d In the far-right movement, this twisted logic falls under the banner of an ideology called \u201caccelerationism\u201d: the belief that accelerating the collapse of society will enable white people to take over and rebuild the world they want.",

                "News snippet:\n\u201cHONOLULU (AP) \u2014 An Oregon man who quit his job at a tire company and liquidated his retirement savings to set sail for Hawaii with his cat, Phoenix, reached his destination Saturday, welcomed by cheering fans at the end of a weekslong journey that he documented for his mass of followers on social media.\n\nOliver Widger, who also was greeted by Hawaii Gov. Josh Green at the Waikiki Yacht Club on Oahu, acknowledged he was nervous facing the crowd, which included reporters. Widger said he was feeling \u201creally weird\u201d \u2014 not seasick, but, \u201cI just feel like I have to, like, hold on to things to not fall over.\u201d\nHe became an online sensation with his story, which followed a diagnosis four years ago with a syndrome that carried a risk of paralysis and made him realize he disliked his managerial job. He quit his job with \u201cno money, no plan\u201d and $10,000 of debt \u2014 and the goal of buying a sailboat and sailing around the world. \n\nHe taught himself to sail mostly via YouTube and moved from Portland to the Oregon coast. He spent months refitting the $50,000 boat he bought.\n\nHe set sail for Hawaii with Phoenix in late April, documenting their experiences for his more than 1 million followers on TikTok and 1.7 million followers on Instagram.

I seem to recall several outages where they found bullet holes.\n\n\nDepartment of Energy data suggests suspicious energy grid disruptions are on the rise, especially in the Western U.S.,\u00a0historically a white supremacist stronghold. In reports filed to the DOE, power grid operators identified 200 instances of vandalism, suspicious activity, sabotage or physical attacks in 2023, comprising 58% of all reported incidents. (Other reports cited factors like severe weather, cyberattacks or equipment failures.) That represents a large increase over the last five years. In 2017, just 9.3% of reported disturbances noted suspicious circumstances, a number that rises to 20-to-30% from 2018 to 2021. Over the past decade, roughly half of these attacks happened in the West.\u00a0\n\nThe FBI made arrests in three different white supremacist plots involving substations, all interrupted in 2020. In one case, three men who met through a neo-Nazi chat room planned to shoot up substations to take down the national energy grid. They were caught only because a man the group was recruiting lost his phone; the person who found it found Nazi propaganda on it and turned it over to the police. In the government\u2019s sentencing memorandum for one of the men, prosecutors said they \u201cplanned to attack substations with powerful rifles that would penetrate the transformers\u201d because they believed it would \u201ccause confusion and unrest\u201d and cost the government millions. \u201cThere was even discussion that their plan could succeed in producing a race war and the next Great Depression,\u201d the memo says. All three pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to provide material support to terrorists; one still awaits sentencing, and the\u00a0other two\u00a0are serving five- and seven-year prison terms.\n\nAnother three men were arrested at a Las Vegas Black Lives Matter protest with Molotov cocktails in their car, according to a Department of Justice\u00a0statement. The government alleges that the men, who claimed to be members of the far-right \u201cBoogaloo\u201d movement, had also plotted to firebomb a substation. Two pled guilty and were sentenced to between four and 20 years, while a third received life in prison.\n\nThe FBI also charged four men in another 2020 plot that involved conspiring to destroy an energy facility, as well as stealing military gear to carry out the attack. Two of them pleaded guilty; the other two pleaded not guilty and are still awaiting trial. Court documents allege that two of the co-conspirators met online in a neo-Nazi forum and recruited others, and the group shared photos of themselves giving the Nazi \u201cSieg Heil\u201d salute. In a detention hearing for one of the accused, Chris Little, a special agent for the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), testified that one of the men had compiled a list of assassination targets associated with the Black Lives Matter movement. Little testified that the person also handwrote a list of intersections in cities across the West, including Boise, Portland, Seattle and San Francisco. Every intersection contained energy infrastructure.\u00a0\n\nThe men, Little testified, wanted to create an outage because it \u201cdiverts the police, causes chaos from the outage itself, causes damage to the equipment, takes a long time to replace and causes an outage of significant length.\u201d They planned to use that chaos \u201cto create a favorable operating environment to conduct an assassination.\u201d In the far-right movement, this twisted logic falls under the banner of an ideology called \u201caccelerationism\u201d: the belief that accelerating the collapse of society will enable white people to take over and rebuild the world they want.",

Josh Green at the Waikiki Yacht Club on Oahu, acknowledged he was nervous facing the crowd, which included reporters. Widger said he was feeling \u201creally weird\u201d \u2014 not seasick, but, \u201cI just feel like I have to, like, hold on to things to not fall over.\u201d\nHe became an online sensation with his story, which followed a diagnosis four years ago with a syndrome that carried a risk of paralysis and made him realize he disliked his managerial job. He quit his job with \u201cno money, no plan\u201d and $10,000 of debt \u2014 and the goal of buying a sailboat and sailing around the world. \n\nHe taught himself to sail mostly via YouTube and moved from Portland to the Oregon coast. He spent months refitting the $50,000 boat he bought.\n\nHe set sail for Hawaii with Phoenix in late April, documenting their experiences for his more than 1 million followers on TikTok and 1.7 million followers on Instagram. He said he thinks his story, which made national news, resonated with people. \n\u201cI think a lot of people are, you know, you\u2019re grinding at your job all day long and it doesn\u2019t really matter how much money you make at this point, everybody\u2019s just trying to do enough to get by and that just wears you out,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the world\u2019s in a weird place, and I think people have seen that it\u2019s possible to break.",
                "I could not begin to imagine the juxtaposition of being totally solitary (all due respect to Phoenix the cat) for weeks, and then to arrive to a big crowd gathered for just you to socialize. I suppose it\u2019s a different kind of \u201csolitary\u201d when he\u2019s locked into social media, but still has to be night and day.\u00a0\n\nThe magnitude of accomplishment isn\u2019t the same, but I believe he and Charles Lindbergh could see eye to eye on what that feeling was like.\u00a0",

                "I'm glad he made it.  Wasn't terribly worried, the weather had been nice and he had constant communications.  But still, things happen at sea.\n\nMakes me think of Steve and Alix over in Massachusetts, with their massive multi-year project to build a sail ship called *Arabella* and start taking her around the world.  When she got put in the water for the first time it was a huge deal.",
                "I wonder how he went from quitting his job being $10k in debt, to buying a $60k sailboat? Maybe took a loan? Just curious."

                ">A Florida man who shot dolphins attracted to baited fishing lines cast from boats he operated was sentenced to 30 days in prison and one year of supervised release.\n\n>Zackery Brandon Barfield, 31, not only shot the bottlenose dolphins but also used poisoned bait after growing frustrated that they were eating from his charter fishing clients, according to prosecutors, who said the crimes happened in 2022 and 2023.\n\n>Prosecutors and federal law enforcement with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Barfield shot at five dolphins, killing at least one, and used poisoned bait on dozens more during outings from Panama City.\n\n>\u201cHe knew the regulations protecting dolphins, yet he killed them anyway \u2014 once in front of children,\u201d federal environmental prosecutor Adam Gustafson said Friday in a statement. Barfield\u2019s attorney in the case did not immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday.\n\n>Barfield opened fire while two elementary school-aged children were on board and, separately, while more than a dozen fishermen were on board boats he operated, prosecutors said.\n\n>He used poisoned bait even more prodigiously, they said.\n\n>\"Barfield fed an estimated 24\u201370 dolphins poison-laden baitfish on charter trips that he captained,\" NOAA Fisheries said in a separate statement Friday.\n\nHe was mad because the dolphins were doing a better job at catching the fish than his customers were. \n\nIt\u2019s a light sentence considering how long he was doing this and how many dolphins he cruelly killed.

                "They tried this in the states a little while back and didn't accomplish much because Americans tend to try to shoot everything. I seem to recall several outages where they found bullet holes.\n\n\nDepartment of Energy data suggests suspicious energy grid disruptions are on the rise, especially in the Western U.S.,\u00a0historically a white supremacist stronghold. In reports filed to the DOE, power grid operators identified 200 instances of vandalism, suspicious activity, sabotage or physical attacks in 2023, comprising 58% of all reported incidents. (Other reports cited factors like severe weather, cyberattacks or equipment failures.) That represents a large increase over the last five years. In 2017, just 9.3% of reported disturbances noted suspicious circumstances, a number that rises to 20-to-30% from 2018 to 2021. Over the past decade, roughly half of these attacks happened in the West.\u00a0\n\nThe FBI made arrests in three different white supremacist plots involving substations, all interrupted in 2020. In one case, three men who met through a neo-Nazi chat room planned to shoot up substations to take down the national energy grid. They were caught only because a man the group was recruiting lost his phone; the person who found it found Nazi propaganda on it and turned it over to the police. In the government\u2019s sentencing memorandum for one of the men, prosecutors said they \u201cplanned to attack substations with powerful rifles that would penetrate the transformers\u201d because they believed it would \u201ccause confusion and unrest\u201d and cost the government millions. \u201cThere was even discussion that their plan could succeed in producing a race war and the next Great Depression,\u201d the memo says. All three pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to provide material support to terrorists; one still awaits sentencing, and the\u00a0other two\u00a0are serving five- and seven-year prison terms.\n\nAnother three men were arrested at a Las Vegas Black Lives Matter protest with Molotov cocktails in their car, according to a Department of Justice\u00a0statement. The government alleges that the men, who claimed to be members of the far-right \u201cBoogaloo\u201d movement, had also plotted to firebomb a substation. Two pled guilty and were sentenced to between four and 20 years, while a third received life in prison.\n\nThe FBI also charged four men in another 2020 plot that involved conspiring to destroy an energy facility, as well as stealing military gear to carry out the attack. Two of them pleaded guilty; the other two pleaded not guilty and are still awaiting trial. Court documents allege that two of the co-conspirators met online in a neo-Nazi forum and recruited others, and the group shared photos of themselves giving the Nazi \u201cSieg Heil\u201d salute. In a detention hearing for one of the accused, Chris Little, a special agent for the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), testified that one of the men had compiled a list of assassination targets associated with the Black Lives Matter movement. Little testified that the person also handwrote a list of intersections in cities across the West, including Boise, Portland, Seattle and San Francisco. Every intersection contained energy infrastructure.\u00a0\n\nThe men, Little testified, wanted to create an outage because it \u201cdiverts the police, causes chaos from the outage itself, causes damage to the equipment, takes a long time to replace and causes an outage of significant length.\u201d They planned to use that chaos \u201cto create a favorable operating environment to conduct an assassination.\u201d In the far-right movement, this twisted logic falls under the banner of an ideology called \u201caccelerationism\u201d: the belief that accelerating the collapse of society will enable white people to take over and rebuild the world they want.",
