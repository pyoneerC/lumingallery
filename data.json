It's a decent movie with some big names but it has more of a TV movie feel IMHO. People on the campaign (and characters in the movie) like Nicole Wallace have said it is accurate. It's amazing how bad of a choice she was for his running mate. She did some wacky shit and really tanked his campaign."
