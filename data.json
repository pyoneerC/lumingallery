I have a lot of patients who don't have great insurance but want to have different plastic surgery procedures done and they travel down to Miami to get it done. I'm honestly not sure if it's just one group that does this or if there's several that compete. But apparently they have cheaper cash rates or some sort of payment plan that they can afford. I've had more complications from those handful of patients that go there than all of my other patients who've ever had it done locally have had. The problem is is it's difficult when there is a complication for a surgeon here to want to take on another doctor's mess that was from down 5 hours away at best. \n\nEvery time one of my patients says they're going to do that or looking at doing it. I try to talk them out of it. But I guess the price is just too good down there and they don't consider it a risk. I'll share this story with them from now on.",

Not everyone who has surgery has a support network to care for them and hospitals will not perform surgery unless you can be discharged into someone\u2019s care. So while it is true these \u201crecovery houses\u201d often care for plastic surgery patients, I\u2019ve seen them used by folks who needed non-elective surgeries.

Then they often send them home far too early (day of), and push all post surg follow up care back onto the family care provider because the surgeon discharged them and said they were good to go home and to talk to their family care provide. The patients aren\u2019t going to hop a flight back to Miami for care, so family med gets stuck with being cornered on taking out sutures and providing follow up care.
