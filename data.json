A Republican known for his pragmatism, Ryan served as governor from 1999 to 2003. He gained international recognition for halting executions and commuting all death row sentences in Illinois, citing systemic injustices in the capital punishment system. However, his career was marred by a corruption scandal dating back to his tenure as secretary of state, leading to a 2006 conviction for racketeering, bribery, extortion, money laundering, and tax fraud. He served over five years in federal prison and was released in 2013.",
