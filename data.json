Kato Crews said that threats against election and other government officials are on the rise and people need to remember that differences need to be worked out through the democratic process, not violence.\n\n>\u201cThe public must not accept this as the norm,\u201d he said in handing down the sentence for Teak Ty Brockbank.\n\n>Brockbank pleaded guilty in October to making threats between September 2021 and August 2022 against Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold and former Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, who is now governor. He also threatened a Colorado judge and federal agents.\n\n>Brockbank apologized in court for his \u201cugly posts\u201d and said he has turned away from the fear, hate and anger that he found online that derailed his life.\n\n>Federal prosecutors sought three years in prison for Brockbank. He asked for leniency, saying he made the posts when he was drinking heavily, socially isolated and spending his evenings consuming conspiracy theories online. Jonathan Jacobson, a Washington-based trial attorney for the Justice Department\u2019s public integrity section, pointed out that the threats continued during a period when Brockbank wasn\u2019t drinking.\n\n>Brockbank posted online that Colorado\u2019s top election official should \u201cHang by the neck\u201d and her former counterpart in Arizona should also be put to death.\n\nKeyboard warrior or not, the nutcase deserves what he got, and then some.",
