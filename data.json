They\u2019re deliberately misleading the public into thinking this was a full term viable pregnancy rather than what it really is which is the same age most pregnancies fail.

This has major implications.",

Her family hasn\u2019t gotten a chance to grieve. Her mother is going to live with this trauma for the rest of her life. \n\nAnd they\u2019re going to get the bill for all of this when they\u2019re finally allowed to let her pass.\n\nThe cruelty is the point, but it\u2019s amazing how often they keep coming up with new ways of being even crueler.",

She's braindead because of that. They aren't just keeping her on life support to incubate the fetus, they KILLED HER in order to incubate the fetus."

                "The US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, said on Wednesday that he had directed the FDA to review the regulations around the abortion pill mifepristone.\n\nThe review, he said, was necessary due to \u201cnew data\u201d \u2013 data that emerged from a flawed analysis that top US anti-abortion groups are now using to pressure the Trump administration to reimpose restrictions on the abortion pill, if not pull it from the market entirely.\n\n...**The analysis, which has not been peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal**, came after the Food and Drug Administration commissioner said he was open to reviewing new safety data on the pills, which are used in nearly two-thirds of abortions nationwide.\n\nThe conservative organizations are rallying behind a paper published on 28 April by a rightwing thinktank, the Ethics and Public Policy Center, which claims there are higher complication rates from taking mifepristone than previously known.\n\nThe paper has attracted scrutiny for appearing to dramatically overstate what it characterizes as \u201cserious adverse effects\u201d associated with the pill, according to medical experts. For example, it counts ectopic pregnancies \u2013 when an embryo implants somewhere other than the uterine lining \u2013 as a serious complication.\n\nMifepristone does not cause an ectopic pregnancy and taking it will not harm someone with an ectopic. It also claims that needing an in-clinic procedure to complete the abortion is a complication, when patients are counseled in advance about the pills\u2019 failure rate of about 3 to 4%.\n\n**The data, the authors say, means the FDA should reinstate earlier restrictions on mifepristone, including a ban on telemedicine and limiting use to the first seven weeks of pregnancy \u2013 but they do not intend to stop there.**\n\nThe authors note that restoring the limits could lead to better monitoring that could help \u201cdetermine whether this drug should remain on the market\u201d, statements that echo proposals found in Project 2025, the 900-page playbook published by the Heritage Foundation and for which the EPPC was an advisory board member.\n\n**Project 2025 calls to end telemedicine prescriptions of abortion pills as an \u201cinterim step\u201d to revoking mifepristone\u2019s approval altogether.**\n\nMore than 100 scientific studies have found the medications cited in the paper are safe and effective for ending a pregnancy.",

Which is also why child labor is so important, so that they could obviously have left the marriage if they didn't want to be there.\n\nIt also makes sense of other agenda pushes that would otherwise feel pointless and unrelated, like the absolute insane amounts of hate against women they've pushed on the youth in recent years."

I don't know the state of PA so I don't know how this affects those closing campuses but I do feel that it's better to close than to occupy at limited capacity just to state that you're still open.

The former controls aircraft at cruising altitude; they are handed off to Approach Control approximately 50 miles out from the airport. Approach is responsible for vectoring and separation beyond that point.",

A controller eventually was able to contact one pilot on what\u2019s called a guard line \u2014 which is typically used when a pilot is in distress \u2014 and that pilot was able to contact the other aircraft to tell them to change frequencies.",

                "So if we want to be very clear, the SCOTUS are not debating the birthright citizenship issue outright. They are debating/ruling on whether the lower courts had the authority to put an injunction on Trump's end to birthright citizenship. Obviously this will have an immediate direct effect on birthright citizenship if the courts overturn it, but then the executive order itself would have to be brought before the SCOTUS.",
                "This case is not really about the merits of the administration\u2019s interpretation of the 14th amendment and birthright citizenship.\n\nRather, the questions are focused more on whether courts has the authority to enjoin executive action, nationwide, through something called a \u201cuniversal injunction.\u201d\n\nSurprisingly, several of the conservatives justices seemed skeptical of the administration\u2019s position on these universal injunctions, as they pressed the solicitor general to explain how affected individuals would even have an effective remedy for constitutional-rights violations if a court has no authority to impose a universal injunction on facially unconstitutional executive action. \u00a0",
                "More insidious than that.\n\nThe trump admin is trying to get the SC to rule that lower courts cannot grant injunction relief except in their own court and affecting only those specific plaintiffs.    This would slow down and increase the cost of taking the government to court for unlawful actions.   They want the court to change due process on injunctive relief.  And by change, I mean , take away.",
                "As it\u2019s been the law of the land up to now, I\u2019m hoping the Court will fall back on the historical application of the law and not restrict it now.  Crossing fingers!",

                "Up until this ruling I believed I was a US citizen by virtue of being born here and having a birth certificate to attest that fact.  Now I have no clear way of determining whether in fact I am a citizen, what rules apply?  How are those rules changed and how does it affect whose citizenship?  It\u2019s all crazy."
