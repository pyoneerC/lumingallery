Jonathan Jacobson, a Washington-based trial attorney for the Justice Department\u2019s public integrity section, pointed out that the threats continued during a period when Brockbank wasn\u2019t drinking.\n\n>Brockbank posted online that Colorado\u2019s top election official should \u201cHang by the neck\u201d and her former counterpart in Arizona should also be put to death.\n\nKeyboard warrior or not, the nutcase deserves what he got, and then some.",
