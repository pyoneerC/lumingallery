                "\n#Canadian Woman Detained at US Border in Harrowing Ordeal\n\nA British Columbia woman has found herself trapped in a nightmare after being unexpectedly detained at the US border and transferred to an Arizona detention centre under conditions her family describes as inhumane.\n\nJasmine Mooney, a 35-year-old businesswoman from Abbotsford, was attempting to enter the United States through the San Ysidro border crossing between Mexico and San Diego on 3 March. She had hoped to apply for a Trade NAFTA (TN) work visa, but her paperwork was incomplete. Instead of being turned away or allowed to rectify the issue, she was arrested by US border officers and placed in detention.\n\nWhat followed has left her mother, Alexis Eagles, desperate for answers. After three nights at a San Diego detention centre, Mooney was handed over to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. For a brief moment, her family thought she had been released when an online tracking system marked her as free. Then she vanished.\n\nPanic set in when hours turned into a full day with no word from her. Eventually, the family learned that Mooney and around thirty others had been pulled from their cells in the middle of the night and transported to the San Luis Detention Center in Arizona. There, according to reports from inside, she has been crammed into a concrete cell with no natural light, harsh fluorescent bulbs that never switch off, no proper bedding and limited bathroom facilities.\n\nMooney has not been charged with any crime. She has no criminal record. She has simply been caught in a bureaucratic nightmare that has left her in chains, awaiting a resolution that remains unclear.\n\nHer mother is not disputing the right of US authorities to refuse Mooney entry. She does, however, take issue with the treatment her daughter is enduring. Mooney herself, in text messages to a business partner, described the conditions as \"inhumane.\" The women in detention are sleeping on mats, the food is barely edible, and the lights make proper rest impossible. Despite the circumstances, Mooney has tried to stay strong, telling her friend that she is in a better position than others and must keep going.\n\nMooney is no stranger to hard work. She built a career in Vancouver\u2019s hospitality industry after moving there from the Yukon in 2008, later expanding into the health and wellness sector. Her most recent work had her involved in Los Angeles, where she had previously been granted a TN work visa. That visa was revoked in November last year when she attempted to return to the US after a vacation. This time, hoping to secure another visa, she took the route that had worked for her before, crossing from Mexico. It was a decision that led to an ordeal beyond anything she could have imagined.\n\nHer business partner, BJ McCaslin, has been in touch with her through a prison communication app and is deeply concerned. He does not understand why she remains detained when there is no evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nGlobal Affairs Canada has acknowledged Mooney's detention and confirmed that consular officials are in contact with US authorities. Beyond that, they say little can be done. While governments may express concern, they rarely intervene when another country enforces its own immigration rules.\n\nThat leaves Mooney and her family in an agonising state of limbo. They are not asking for special treatment, only basic human decency. For now, all they can do is wait, and hope that her ordeal does not stretch on indefinitely.",
                "THIS is another reason for Canadians to avoid all US travel.",
                "Perhaps countries should issue travel advisories for the U.S.",
                "And the other people in her situation don't even have a resourceful Canadian mom to get attention to their cause, so even if the poor woman who in no way deserves this random act of cruelty by the US regime is released the problem remains",
                "Why not just turn her back? There\u2019s no reason to lock her up. I hope they get the ACLU involved. She has constitutional rights and they\u2019re being violated.",
                "The Terror begins. To be clear, this woman was detained because her application to renew her work visa was incomplete. That's it. That's all she did and she ended up in a cell for a week with nothing but a mat and rotten food.",
                "How're the US supposed to host the world cup next year if they're putting loads of people in chains??\n\nI have a feeling foreigners may want to stay away and stadiums will be empty af",
                "So I\u2019ve been reading a book recently (When Mckinsey comes to town) and it says during the first Trump admiration many ICE employees had begun to find the work distasteful based on the orders coming from the government at that time, as well as bad press. As a result ICE was struggling to find and retain employees. The solution? Change hiring practices to recruit neckbeards who get a kick out of having the power to detain and arrest people. Basically adult Eric Cartmans demanding \u201crespect ma authoritah!\u201d It\u2019s all Trump loyalists now. Same goes for many police forces.",
                "> \u201cWe eventually learned that about 30 people, including Jasmine, were removed from their cells at 3 a.m. and transferred to the San Luis Detention Center in Arizona. They are housed together in a single concrete cell with no natural light, fluorescent lights that are never turned off, no mats, no blankets, and limited bathroom facilities.\"\n\n So she tried to go to the border with a new job offer and visa paperwork. This was the process she'd followed before, and she was trying to follow the laws to the best of her understanding. Instead they put her in chains and did this to her. People in our prison system are treated with more dignity than this.",
                "This isn't about security\u2014it's about cruelty. And the worst part? There\u2019s no accountability. ICE can do whatever they want, and people like Mooney are left in limbo. America\u2019s broken system strikes again."

The finding is the lynchpin for the agency\u2019s regulations about greenhouse gas pollution under the Clean Air Act.\u00a0",

                "\n#Canadian Woman Detained at US Border in Harrowing Ordeal\n\nA British Columbia woman has found herself trapped in a nightmare after being unexpectedly detained at the US border and transferred to an Arizona detention centre under conditions her family describes as inhumane.\n\nJasmine Mooney, a 35-year-old businesswoman from Abbotsford, was attempting to enter the United States through the San Ysidro border crossing between Mexico and San Diego on 3 March. She had hoped to apply for a Trade NAFTA (TN) work visa, but her paperwork was incomplete. Instead of being turned away or allowed to rectify the issue, she was arrested by US border officers and placed in detention.\n\nWhat followed has left her mother, Alexis Eagles, desperate for answers. After three nights at a San Diego detention centre, Mooney was handed over to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. For a brief moment, her family thought she had been released when an online tracking system marked her as free. Then she vanished.\n\nPanic set in when hours turned into a full day with no word from her. Eventually, the family learned that Mooney and around thirty others had been pulled from their cells in the middle of the night and transported to the San Luis Detention Center in Arizona. There, according to reports from inside, she has been crammed into a concrete cell with no natural light, harsh fluorescent bulbs that never switch off, no proper bedding and limited bathroom facilities.\n\nMooney has not been charged with any crime. She has no criminal record. She has simply been caught in a bureaucratic nightmare that has left her in chains, awaiting a resolution that remains unclear.\n\nHer mother is not disputing the right of US authorities to refuse Mooney entry. She does, however, take issue with the treatment her daughter is enduring. Mooney herself, in text messages to a business partner, described the conditions as \"inhumane.\" The women in detention are sleeping on mats, the food is barely edible, and the lights make proper rest impossible. Despite the circumstances, Mooney has tried to stay strong, telling her friend that she is in a better position than others and must keep going.\n\nMooney is no stranger to hard work. She built a career in Vancouver\u2019s hospitality industry after moving there from the Yukon in 2008, later expanding into the health and wellness sector. Her most recent work had her involved in Los Angeles, where she had previously been granted a TN work visa. That visa was revoked in November last year when she attempted to return to the US after a vacation. This time, hoping to secure another visa, she took the route that had worked for her before, crossing from Mexico. It was a decision that led to an ordeal beyond anything she could have imagined.\n\nHer business partner, BJ McCaslin, has been in touch with her through a prison communication app and is deeply concerned. He does not understand why she remains detained when there is no evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nGlobal Affairs Canada has acknowledged Mooney's detention and confirmed that consular officials are in contact with US authorities. Beyond that, they say little can be done. While governments may express concern, they rarely intervene when another country enforces its own immigration rules.\n\nThat leaves Mooney and her family in an agonising state of limbo. They are not asking for special treatment, only basic human decency. For now, all they can do is wait, and hope that her ordeal does not stretch on indefinitely.",
                "THIS is another reason for Canadians to avoid all US travel.",
                "Perhaps countries should issue travel advisories for the U.S.",
                "And the other people in her situation don't even have a resourceful Canadian mom to get attention to their cause, so even if the poor woman who in no way deserves this random act of cruelty by the US regime is released the problem remains",
                "Why not just turn her back? There\u2019s no reason to lock her up. I hope they get the ACLU involved. She has constitutional rights and they\u2019re being violated.",
                "The Terror begins. To be clear, this woman was detained because her application to renew her work visa was incomplete. That's it. That's all she did and she ended up in a cell for a week with nothing but a mat and rotten food.",

As a result ICE was struggling to find and retain employees. The solution? Change hiring practices to recruit neckbeards who get a kick out of having the power to detain and arrest people. Basically adult Eric Cartmans demanding \u201crespect ma authoritah!\u201d It\u2019s all Trump loyalists now. Same goes for many police forces.",
                "> \u201cWe eventually learned that about 30 people, including Jasmine, were removed from their cells at 3 a.m. and transferred to the San Luis Detention Center in Arizona. They are housed together in a single concrete cell with no natural light, fluorescent lights that are never turned off, no mats, no blankets, and limited bathroom facilities.\"\n\n So she tried to go to the border with a new job offer and visa paperwork. This was the process she'd followed before, and she was trying to follow the laws to the best of her understanding. Instead they put her in chains and did this to her. People in our prison system are treated with more dignity than this.",
                "This isn't about security\u2014it's about cruelty. And the worst part? There\u2019s no accountability. ICE can do whatever they want, and people like Mooney are left in limbo. America\u2019s broken system strikes again."

The former CEO, who is married and has two daughters, acknowledged he met the woman through Epstein, but while he told the court \u201cshe was part of his staff\u201d, he claimed Epstein did not know they had sex.***\n\n>*\u201cHow did it come about that you had sexual intercourse with a woman who worked for him at an apartment, owned by his brother, without him knowing?\u201d Mulcahy asked.*\n\n>*Staley said: \u201cOftentimes I would go to Epstein\u2019s apartment and he would be late, and she and I got the chance to know each other.\u201d This led to sexual intercourse, he said, \u201cmuch to my embarrassment today\u201d.*\n\n>*The ex-banker agreed with Mulcahy that he would describe the intercourse as \u201cconsensual\u201d. The date of the encounter and the age of the woman were not disclosed in court. The FCA stated that the property was owned by Epstein\u2019s brother.*\n\n>*Mulcahy also put to Staley that the staff member \u201cappeared to have carved you out of a settlement with the Epstein estate\u201d. Staley replied he was \u201cnot aware of that\u201d.*\n\n>*The ex-Barclays boss also maintained that he did not remember the context for a separate, and now notorious, exchange with Epstein in 2010 referring to Disney princesses.*",
