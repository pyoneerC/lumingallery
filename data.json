Des Moines* in 1969 is the key controlling decision; in that case students sued their school after the school told them they could not wear black armbands to protest the Vietnam War. Guess which side the conservatives were on then? It wasn't the side that wants students to be able to wear political messages on their clothes in school!\n\nIn *Bethel School District v Frasier* in 1986, the Supreme Court held that schools have the right to restrict / prohibit student speech (in this case, vulgar innuendo in a commencement address). Again, conservatives would absolutely not want that student right restored / expanded.\n\nExcept but now we're supposed to believe that conservatives legitimately hold the opposite beliefs?\n\nCome on.\n\nOnce again, I resent how dumb and gullible right-wingers assume the rest of us are.
