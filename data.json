It's a problem you can throw huge sums of money and it doesn't really alleviate the problem nor change the societal direction of homelessness. It's not just people who lack economic resource. If it was *just* about money, we'd have it nailed by now. Mental illness and other disabilities make up a large portion of the homeless community. A lot of these people, constitutionally, cannot care for themselves. They aren't lazy. They aren't unmotivated. They suffer from conditions that, often, render them literally incapable of doing the most basic elements of self-care. We need a system entirely devoted to this totally vulnerable part of our population. These are people that need assistance and have no way of paying for that assistance. We must help them in an organized, society-wide way because it is both he moral thing to do *and* the most practical thing we could to help restore some order to how our streets function. Meeting the needs of the homeless disabled population is a win win. And once we figure out the best way of helping that part of the homeless population you can build institutions designed to uniquely address the needs of other groups of homeless people.

However, since the crime was committed before Illinois abolished discretionary parole in 1978, Hoover is eligible for a hearing with the Illinois Prisoner Review Board.\n\nIn all likelihood, Illinois will let Hoover out of prison. According to the Chicago Sun-Times, the Illinois Prisoner Review Board has freed [far worse criminals](https://chicago.suntimes.com/2020/7/24/21336624/illinois-prisoner-review-board-parole-larry-hoover-gangster-disciples-otis-williams-hatchet-murderer) convicted under the older law, many of whom absolutely would've been sent to prison for life or even executed had they committed their crimes a few years later. For example, in 2018, 70-year-old Ruben Taylor, a convicted mass murderer and probable serial killer, was paroled after 46 years in prison. He was part of a gang that killed 10 people in Chicago in 1972.\n\n>Ruben Taylor, 70, a member of the De Mau Mau gang that killed a Barrington Hills family in 1972. The gang randomly picked the home to rob. They forced Paul and Marion Corbett, their 22-year-old daughter and her aunt into a pantry. Their pet dachshund barked at the intruders, and a robber threw a knife at it. The daughter told him to stay away from the dog, and Taylor shot her in the chest. His brother Donald shot each of the other three family members in the head. Taylor was sentenced to 100 to 150 years. Asked by a parole board member how he'd respond to being called \"unrepentant,\" he answered, \"They don't know me and haven't walked in my shoes\" but also said, \"What can you say, other than you're sorry?\"\n> \n>The board granted Taylor parole by a vote of 8-4 in 2018.",

It's a problem you can throw huge sums of money and it doesn't really alleviate the problem nor change the societal direction of homelessness. It's not just people who lack economic resource. If it was *just* about money, we'd have it nailed by now. Mental illness and other disabilities make up a large portion of the homeless community. A lot of these people, constitutionally, cannot care for themselves. They aren't lazy. They aren't unmotivated. They suffer from conditions that, often, render them literally incapable of doing the most basic elements of self-care. We need a system entirely devoted to this totally vulnerable part of our population. These are people that need assistance and have no way of paying for that assistance. We must help them in an organized, society-wide way because it is both he moral thing to do *and* the most practical thing we could to help restore some order to how our streets function. Meeting the needs of the homeless disabled population is a win win. And once we figure out the best way of helping that part of the homeless population you can build institutions designed to uniquely address the needs of other groups of homeless people. For some, it's going to be to offer shelter and assistance while they pursue better employment. For others, it may mean help with alcoholism and/or addiction.

However, since the crime was committed before Illinois abolished discretionary parole in 1978, Hoover is eligible for a hearing with the Illinois Prisoner Review Board.\n\nIn all likelihood, Illinois will let Hoover out of prison. According to the Chicago Sun-Times, the Illinois Prisoner Review Board has freed [far worse criminals](https://chicago.suntimes.com/2020/7/24/21336624/illinois-prisoner-review-board-parole-larry-hoover-gangster-disciples-otis-williams-hatchet-murderer) convicted under the older law, many of whom absolutely would've been sent to prison for life or even executed had they committed their crimes a few years later. For example, in 2018, 70-year-old Ruben Taylor, a convicted mass murderer and probable serial killer, was paroled after 46 years in prison. He was part of a gang that killed 10 people in Chicago in 1972.\n\n>Ruben Taylor, 70, a member of the De Mau Mau gang that killed a Barrington Hills family in 1972. The gang randomly picked the home to rob. They forced Paul and Marion Corbett, their 22-year-old daughter and her aunt into a pantry. Their pet dachshund barked at the intruders, and a robber threw a knife at it. The daughter told him to stay away from the dog, and Taylor shot her in the chest. His brother Donald shot each of the other three family members in the head. Taylor was sentenced to 100 to 150 years. Asked by a parole board member how he'd respond to being called \"unrepentant,\" he answered, \"They don't know me and haven't walked in my shoes\" but also said, \"What can you say, other than you're sorry?\"\n> \n>The board granted Taylor parole by a vote of 8-4 in 2018.",

                "Places where people are sleeping on the streets are dangerous and inhumane but, honestly, I don't know what the answer is in terms of dealing with the many different reasons that propel people into lives of daily desperation, pain and suffering. It's a problem you can throw huge sums of money and it doesn't really alleviate the problem nor change the societal direction of homelessness. It's not just people who lack economic resource. If it was *just* about money, we'd have it nailed by now. Mental illness and other disabilities make up a large portion of the homeless community. A lot of these people, constitutionally, cannot care for themselves. They aren't lazy. They aren't unmotivated. They suffer from conditions that, often, render them literally incapable of doing the most basic elements of self-care. We need a system entirely devoted to this totally vulnerable part of our population. These are people that need assistance and have no way of paying for that assistance. We must help them in an organized, society-wide way because it is both he moral thing to do *and* the most practical thing we could to help restore some order to how our streets function. Meeting the needs of the homeless disabled population is a win win. And once we figure out the best way of helping that part of the homeless population you can build institutions designed to uniquely address the needs of other groups of homeless people. For some, it's going to be to offer shelter and assistance while they pursue better employment. For others, it may mean help with alcoholism and/or addiction. There are paths forward for people. it is of distinct benefit to all of us to help manifest the successful transformation of their lives.",

However, since the crime was committed before Illinois abolished discretionary parole in 1978, Hoover is eligible for a hearing with the Illinois Prisoner Review Board.\n\nIn all likelihood, Illinois will let Hoover out of prison. According to the Chicago Sun-Times, the Illinois Prisoner Review Board has freed [far worse criminals](https://chicago.suntimes.com/2020/7/24/21336624/illinois-prisoner-review-board-parole-larry-hoover-gangster-disciples-otis-williams-hatchet-murderer) convicted under the older law, many of whom absolutely would've been sent to prison for life or even executed had they committed their crimes a few years later. For example, in 2018, 70-year-old Ruben Taylor, a convicted mass murderer and probable serial killer, was paroled after 46 years in prison. He was part of a gang that killed 10 people in Chicago in 1972.\n\n>Ruben Taylor, 70, a member of the De Mau Mau gang that killed a Barrington Hills family in 1972. The gang randomly picked the home to rob. They forced Paul and Marion Corbett, their 22-year-old daughter and her aunt into a pantry. Their pet dachshund barked at the intruders, and a robber threw a knife at it. The daughter told him to stay away from the dog, and Taylor shot her in the chest. His brother Donald shot each of the other three family members in the head. Taylor was sentenced to 100 to 150 years. Asked by a parole board member how he'd respond to being called \"unrepentant,\" he answered, \"They don't know me and haven't walked in my shoes\" but also said, \"What can you say, other than you're sorry?\"\n> \n>The board granted Taylor parole by a vote of 8-4 in 2018.",
