                "We have filled every corner of the planet with plastic, and now it is sabotaging the very process that keeps life going, photosynthesis. If plants and algae struggle to convert sunlight into energy, we are looking at lower crop yields, collapsing marine ecosystems, and yet another hit to our ability to capture carbon.\n\nThe fact that a mere 13 per cent reduction in plastic pollution could significantly slow this damage makes it even more infuriating. We have known for decades that plastic breaks down into microplastics, yet international talks keep stalling. If we do not act soon, \"plastic planet\" will stop being a metaphor and start being a reality.",
                "*They\u2019re being detected everywhere researchers look, from Antarctic sea ice to* [*human brains*](https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/how-are-microplastics-getting-into-our-brain/)*....   Scientists are  just beginning to understand how these pollutants affect one of the most essential and widespread kingdoms of life on Earth: plants.*\n\nPhotosynthesis is cut from 7-12% which means a similar loss of production.  (add in strokes, heart problems, Alzheimers in people)",
                "This is not something that plants crave.",

                "Eventually companies will be forced to admit that they probably knew there were serious health risks with plastics and other chemicals. Risks ranging from infertility to autism ,even death . It was know for decades how dangerous asbestos was but they used it anyway.The companies just declare bankruptcy and try to shield all wealthy investors  while they destroy Americans. Just like asbestos they have no idea how to get the microplastics out of the body ,it just piles up in the organs, brain and tissue ,autopsies show the increased weight of organs from accumulation. We are all being destroyed.",

                "Reminder that the vast majority of microplastics in the environment, in most cases around 75%, but up to 90%, come from tire wear from cars and other heavy motor vehicles. This problem is not going to be solved by any means by simply switching away from plastic in consumer goods. We have to get away from our dependence on motor vehicles if we want to move the needle.",

Hell, one of John Adam\u2019s first famous acts was being the defense lawyer for the british soldiers in the Boston massacre. He did it not because he agreed with their actions but that our laws are universal or they are worthless. You don\u2019t pick and choose when you want laws to apply. And before down votes happen.
