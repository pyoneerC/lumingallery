                "Young and talented at what, raping?",
                "Unfortunately, the title must exactly match the article, so I couldn\u2019t emphasize that the medical student is actually A GYNAECOLOGY RESIDENT!!!!!!! In other words, while the man is young and talented, the woman he raped\u2014and the women who will be vulnerable and naked alone with him in his practice\u2014apparently are not. :)\n\n\nA similar thing occurred a few years ago in the same belgian courthouse when white elite student club called Reuzegom left their only black member, Sanda Dia, for dead after subjecting him to hours of torture as part of an initiation ritual. He eventually died, and the perpetrators tried to cover their tracks. The verdict was the same: they were found guilty but did not receive any sentencing besides a very low fine of \u20ac400 and some community service (in Belgium, you only get a criminal record if there's an actual sentence and the fine needs to exceed X amount which wasn't the case here so they still have clean records) because they were considered \u201cyoung and promising.\u201d In reality, they were white, wealthy, and one of their fathers was a judge in the same court. A YouTuber who doxxed them was fined \u20ac20K\u2014roughly equivalent to 22K dollars\u2014because it is illegal to publish the names of individuals who do not have a criminal record.",

But, the thing that nobody is really talking about is how he admitted that he is \"inadequate\" (his word) for the time, and that he does not know what the hell to do. Nearly every Senator who asked him a question to give him reprieve from the moment also asked him what they are supposed to do; which is concerning. 0 Senators have an answer. They are doing \\*something\\* here, sure. But their response is going to be null if they actually can't figure out what to do."

There's a number of reasons that courts can diverge from scientific consensus, but what I find really curious is how the bias against the weight of evidence is also over represented in Internet searches and AI responses.\n\nYou'd think that given a company with resources like J&J they would be more effective of getting their narrative out but you have to get pretty deep into a search engine to find critical analysis of the talc claims. And it would be one thing if the critical analysis were coming from small organizations or orgaorg without much prestigious, but that's not the case. \n\nthe American Cancer Society (ACS) states that research on talc and ovarian cancer \u201chave been mixed, with some studies reporting a slightly increased risk and some reporting no increase \u2026 For any individual woman, if there is an increased risk, the overall increase is likely to be very small.\u201d\n\nThe NCI concludes that \u201cthe weight of evidence does not support an association between perineal talc exposure and an increased risk of ovarian cancer.\u201d\n\nSo you've got two major cancer based orgs stating that the evidence is either weak or absent, and yet their messages are not ones you'd come across readily with a quick search asking about the evidence. \n\nIt's probably because this topic is on the more nuanced end of the spectrum where you have to really look at how to weigh different studies in determining whether there's a cause and effect connection, and it's one most of us just don't have the skill sets to interpret correctly",
