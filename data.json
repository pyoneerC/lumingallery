Cattle will be kept and fed less safely. Slaughterhouses and beef packaging plants will be understaffed. There will be no government oversight to ensure meat is not spoiled when packaged or stored unsafely. When inevitable outbreaks occur, recalls will be less likely.

It wasn't until the 1990s and early 2000s that we realized how important fire is for ecosystems like this.

Cattle will be kept and fed less safely. Slaughterhouses and beef packaging plants will be understaffed. There will be no government oversight to ensure meat is not spoiled when packaged or stored unsafely. When inevitable outbreaks occur, recalls will be less likely. Then the FDA and the CDC cannot tell consumers about the danger if there is an outbreak, anyway. Widespread illness and death occur.  BUT, at least business owners and politicians made more money.
