One said Holmberg gave him money to film sex acts in the 1990s. The other man who spoke at the hearing was a cooperating witness who said Holmberg used his political power to groom them for sex. \n\n* Holmberg said in court that he traveled to Prague with the intent of having sexual contact with minors, that he liked massages and some involved sexual contact. He said he might have received a sexual massage from someone under 18, but he\u2019s not sure.\n\n* In one message, Holmberg sent a cooperating witness a link to a brothel in Prague with the comment, \u201cThe boys rent at around $60 \u2026 (sex is extra).\u201d\n\n* Holmberg was linked to the investigation of Nicholas Morgan-Derosier, a Grand Forks man who was sentenced in May to 40 years on child pornography charges.\n\n* Holmberg, a Republican who held the powerful positions of Senate Appropriations Committee chair and head of Legislative Management, resigned from the Legislature in 2022. He was indicted on federal charges in October 2023.\n\n* Ray Holmberg, 81, was a Grand Forks state senator for 45 years, and received a sentence that is longer than federal sentencing guidelines. \n\n* U.S. District Judge Daniel Hovland characterized Holmberg\u2019s conduct as \u201cegregious and despicable\u201d and said he didn\u2019t think the guideline sentence of more than three years was adequate.\n\n* \u201cFrom my perspective, this was not an isolated case and this is not a victimless crime,\u201d Hovland said. \u201cIt displays a pattern of very vile, sickening criminal behavior.\u201d\n\n* Holmberg was sentenced to *10* years.

                "Some highlights here, though I do encourage everyone to read the article in full. \n\n* Prosecutors allege Holmberg traveled to Prague in the Czech Republic 14 times between 2011 and 2021 to pay for sex with boys. \n\n* Though not part of the charges against Holmberg, two men who said they met him in North Dakota and were victimized by him gave emotional testimony at the hearing. One said Holmberg gave him money to film sex acts in the 1990s. The other man who spoke at the hearing was a cooperating witness who said Holmberg used his political power to groom them for sex. \n\n* Holmberg said in court that he traveled to Prague with the intent of having sexual contact with minors, that he liked massages and some involved sexual contact. He said he might have received a sexual massage from someone under 18, but he\u2019s not sure.\n\n* In one message, Holmberg sent a cooperating witness a link to a brothel in Prague with the comment, \u201cThe boys rent at around $60 \u2026 (sex is extra).\u201d\n\n* Holmberg was linked to the investigation of Nicholas Morgan-Derosier, a Grand Forks man who was sentenced in May to 40 years on child pornography charges.\n\n* Holmberg, a Republican who held the powerful positions of Senate Appropriations Committee chair and head of Legislative Management, resigned from the Legislature in 2022. He was indicted on federal charges in October 2023.\n\n* Ray Holmberg, 81, was a Grand Forks state senator for 45 years, and received a sentence that is longer than federal sentencing guidelines. \n\n* U.S. District Judge Daniel Hovland characterized Holmberg\u2019s conduct as \u201cegregious and despicable\u201d and said he didn\u2019t think the guideline sentence of more than three years was adequate.\n\n* \u201cFrom my perspective, this was not an isolated case and this is not a victimless crime,\u201d Hovland said. \u201cIt displays a pattern of very vile, sickening criminal behavior.\u201d\n\n* Holmberg was sentenced to *10* years. At age 81, it's likely he will die in prison.\n\n* Holmberg is not trans nor a drag queen.",

One said Holmberg gave him money to film sex acts in the 1990s. The other man who spoke at the hearing was a cooperating witness who said Holmberg used his political power to groom them for sex. \n\n* Holmberg said in court that he traveled to Prague with the intent of having sexual contact with minors, that he liked massages and some involved sexual contact. He said he might have received a sexual massage from someone under 18, but he\u2019s not sure.\n\n* In one message, Holmberg sent a cooperating witness a link to a brothel in Prague with the comment, \u201cThe boys rent at around $60 \u2026 (sex is extra).\u201d\n\n* Holmberg was linked to the investigation of Nicholas Morgan-Derosier, a Grand Forks man who was sentenced in May to 40 years on child pornography charges.\n\n* Holmberg, a Republican who held the powerful positions of Senate Appropriations Committee chair and head of Legislative Management, resigned from the Legislature in 2022. He was indicted on federal charges in October 2023.\n\n* Ray Holmberg, 81, was a Grand Forks state senator for 45 years, and received a sentence that is longer than federal sentencing guidelines. \n\n* U.S. District Judge Daniel Hovland characterized Holmberg\u2019s conduct as \u201cegregious and despicable\u201d and said he didn\u2019t think the guideline sentence of more than three years was adequate.\n\n* \u201cFrom my perspective, this was not an isolated case and this is not a victimless crime,\u201d Hovland said. \u201cIt displays a pattern of very vile, sickening criminal behavior.\u201d\n\n* Holmberg was sentenced to *10* years. At age 81, it's likely he will die in prison.\n\n* Holmberg is not trans nor a drag queen.",

                "What are you even supposed to do in this case? Masked unidentified men claiming to be police with unmarked vehicles come to try to take you. Would calling 911 even help? What about self defense?\u00a0",
                "this is INSANE! the article said she wasn't an activist or member of any pro-Palestinian organization. She simply wrote an op-ed article for her campus paper, not even a national media outlet. She didn't organize protests or sit-ins or never was accused of harrassing or accosting Jewish students on campus. And the scary thing about it is that she hasn't even been accused of any crime. Her grad student visa (in the psychology department no less) was terminated on the whims of the Administration.",
                "Gestapo level shit.  Her lawyer has no idea where she is.",
                "People need to stop being complacent about this kind of stuff. They are detaining people with no due process. It's essentially kidnapping people who don't agree with the government's foreign policies. Whatever the fuck happened to free speech. They allow Nazis to walk around waving Swastika flags, but someone who criticizes Israel gets arrested like this? The double standards and hypocrisy of this government is pathetic. I wouldn't be surprised if the people who criticize Elon and Tesla end up getting kidnapped like this too.",
                "Why are they given till Friday to provide information?\n\nI understand if people disagree with someone\u2019s opinion but they are literally violating the first amendment. And before you say she\u2019s not a us citizen, the first amendment applies to all humans. If they can prove she violated some other law then prove it! Due process exists to protect the government and its people. It\u2019s sad that there are Americans who don\u2019t understand this and worse that there are Americans willing to participate.",
                "Individuals here on visas should start considering wearing AirTags in the undergarments so their whereabouts can be traced to some extent. Phones are the first thing they go for.",
                "Unfortunately this is going to give some people evil ideas. You could iterally have 4 or 6 guys walk up to a woman, say they are from ICE and kidnap a person. Just put on a mask, and add a halfway believable badge from your neck....the entire video is less than 2 minutes. How many times a day does this happen?",
                "Trumps secret police. Extinguish all freedom of speech.",
                "I never thought I'd see this in the USA.   Police showing up with masks.   Taking her like she's trash.  No due process.  No excuses.  She had no opportunity to appeal her condition.   And she was here legally.  Committed no crime.   Still not charged, but now in a hell hole.\n\nYou A-holes who voted for Trump...if you're still celebrating, then you show what you have become.   And you know.  It didn't end well for the Nazis either as I recall.",
                "They wore facial masks, so they can\u2019t be identified as cowards because cameras are rolling. Simp cowards."
