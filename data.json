I didn't get frustrated and calmly explained to the cop that the car he was looking for drove past me. \"I understand how this type of mistake can happen, officer,\" I explained, \"but I promise you, I was in cruise control the whole time 1mph below the speed limit.\" He wouldn't have it, so I asked him if he knew how fast he had to go to catch me. He wouldn't answer, so I said, \"If it was less than 100mph, that would explain why you caught me since the car I think you're looking for was going at least 80mph. You caught up to me when you did because I was going 30mph slower.\"\n\nHe wouldn't admit I was right, but said because I didn't give him a \"hard time\" that he was going to let me go with a warning... but that next time I wouldn't get off so easy.\n\nThat whole situation made me start to think about how often cops pull over the wrong person."
