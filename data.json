They are actions that mirror the policies of our enemies. The nation mobilized against such things, pouring out blood and treasure to stop them. It was one of our proudest moments, and one that serves to define how we see ourselves as a nation.\n\nThe Pentagon shouldn't be \"scrambling\" to obey such orders, however technically lawful they may be. This purge impresses a stain on the honor of our Armed Forces that will never be expunged. I would expect them to be slow-walking every step. Every order should be met by the impenetrable bureaucracy and red tape that military organizations are famous for. Every signature should be obtained only after each word of the orders and plans are inspected in detail, reviewed by committees, stamped, filed, lost, found, encoded with reference numbers, and distributed to each relevant department. If a form must be filled out, pens should be requisitioned for the purpose. When the pens arrive, they should be deemed unsuitable because the ink viscosity doesn't comply with procurement regulations. The rejected shipment should be returned, and a refund from the contracted vendor obtained and accounted before a new requisition is originated. And once pens are obtained, the forms can be filled out in proper triplicate, to be separated and filed in their widespread destinations. \n\nUn-American orders need not be expedited; they should be completed with \"all deliberate speed\". Emphasis on \"deliberation\". If the \"Received\" stamp is crooked in its little square, the paperwork should be rejected without explanation until a communication is established to convey that the papers need to be re-done, with a proper cross-reference number linking the rejected paperwork with the replacement.\n\nRemoving an entry on a website *ought to take MONTHS.*"

                "Yeahhh, I think people need to wait and see where this leads. The article is strictly from the plaintiffs perspective because the airline won't comment.\n\nI have a hard time believing a pilot would break a door down to pull a man out who was just using the restroom. There had to be something else going on. \n\nLike was the guy being belligerent? Was he actually suffering from an issue or was he doing something else in the bathroom? Obviously he's not going to say \"yeah I wasn't really going to the bathroom, I was hanging out for 30+ minutes and being a dickhead to the staff.\" Also the plaintiff doesn't specify when it happened, perhaps the plane was close to landing? As everyone knows you can't be in the bathroom during that. Maybe the pilot/flight attendants were concerned he was lying because he was in there for 30+ minutes.\n\nA pilot isn't going to risk their license/job by attacking a passenger and doing damage to the plane. Something had to be going on.",
