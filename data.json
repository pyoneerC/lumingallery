And it would be one thing if the critical analysis were coming from small organizations or orgaorg without much prestigious, but that's not the case. \n\nthe American Cancer Society (ACS) states that research on talc and ovarian cancer \u201chave been mixed, with some studies reporting a slightly increased risk and some reporting no increase \u2026 For any individual woman, if there is an increased risk, the overall increase is likely to be very small.\u201d\n\nThe NCI concludes that \u201cthe weight of evidence does not support an association between perineal talc exposure and an increased risk of ovarian cancer.\u201d\n\nSo you've got two major cancer based orgs stating that the evidence is either weak or absent, and yet their messages are not ones you'd come across readily with a quick search asking about the evidence. \n\nIt's probably because this topic is on the more nuanced end of the spectrum where you have to really look at how to weigh different studies in determining whether there's a cause and effect connection, and it's one most of us just don't have the skill sets to interpret correctly"

And it would be one thing if the critical analysis were coming from small organizations or orgaorg without much prestigious, but that's not the case. \n\nthe American Cancer Society (ACS) states that research on talc and ovarian cancer \u201chave been mixed, with some studies reporting a slightly increased risk and some reporting no increase \u2026 For any individual woman, if there is an increased risk, the overall increase is likely to be very small.\u201d\n\nThe NCI concludes that \u201cthe weight of evidence does not support an association between perineal talc exposure and an increased risk of ovarian cancer.\u201d\n\nSo you've got two major cancer based orgs stating that the evidence is either weak or absent, and yet their messages are not ones you'd come across readily with a quick search asking about the evidence. \n\nIt's probably because this topic is on the more nuanced end of the spectrum where you have to really look at how to weigh different studies in determining whether there's a cause and effect connection, and it's one most of us just don't have the skill sets to interpret correctly"

                "Good god, MS. You really are a sitcom at this point:\n\n\"The Senate bill had typos that essentially nullified the growth triggers and would eliminate the income tax nearly as quickly as the House proposed. The House passed the flawed bill on to the governor, who signed it into law Thursday.\"",
                "If those Mississippi legislators could read they'd be very upset",
                "I couldn't find what the typo was in this article. So I had to look [around](https://mississippitoday.org/2025/03/24/how-did-the-mississippi-typo-tax-swap-act-of-2025-happen-legislative-recap/). For anyone else wondering:\n\nThe latter parts of the tax reduction only occur:\n\n>when revenue surplus equals 85% or more of the cost of a 1% cut in the tax rate.\n\nBut the bill was passed and signed as `.85%`. So the cuts are almost guranteed to continue.",
                "These paragraphs explain how the typo affected things:\n\n>House leaders have long pushed to eliminate the state personal income tax in relatively short order. The Senate had urged a longer-term approach, arguing it would be unwise to slash a third of the state\u2019s revenue in uncertain economic times. Senators last week had conceded to eliminate the income tax, but only with economic growth \u201ctriggers\u201d as safeguards \u2014 the tax wouldn\u2019t phase out unless the state saw robust economic growth and controlled spending. It would have likely taken many years.\n\n>Or so they thought. The Senate bill had typos that essentially nullified the growth triggers and would eliminate the income tax nearly as quickly as the House proposed. The House passed the flawed bill on to the governor, who signed it into law Thursday.",
                "So they say Mississippi is open for business and a bunch of people will move there. Do people really want to live there with no schools, libraries, hospitals, or maybe even fire stations and police? They already can't pay for these things, what is going to happen with no income tax?",
                "Nothing screams \"governing with competence\" like accidentally fast-tracking a massive tax overhaul \\*because of typos\\*. This wasn\u2019t just a clerical hiccup. This is generational economic policy passed by people who \\*didn\u2019t read the fine print\\*. Or maybe they did and hoped no one else would. Either way, Mississippi just gave its wealthiest residents a high-five and told the working poor to budget harder. \n\n\n\nThey\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s bold reform. But behind the curtain? It\u2019s austerity cosplaying as prosperity.",
                "Stop giving this deadbeat red state more federal money than it kicks in.",
                "As a lifetime Mississippi resident, let me assure you - we don\u2019t hide our idiots away, we put them in political positions such as Governor.",
                "Wait until y'all find out [why we no longer have ballot initiatives ](https://apnews.com/article/ms-state-wire-mississippi-marijuana-health-4f81d577aeb2ed8a04849f62c86c707e)",
                "Mississippi is like that brother who's always fucking up and didn't graduate high school. But you still love them because they're your brother. The whole south can't pull it's own weight."

                "Some highlights surrounding this illegal kidnapping and deportation to a concentration camp of a person with lawful protected status in the U.S. lawfully here, married to a U.S. citizen, with a 5 year old disabled child who is also a citizen.\n\n>\u201cThey claim that the court is powerless to order any relief,\u2019\u2019 Sandoval-Moshenberg told me. **\u201cIf that\u2019s true, the immigration laws are meaningless\u2014all of them\u2014because the government can deport whoever they want, wherever they want, whenever they want, and no court can do anything about it once it\u2019s done.\u201d**\n> . . .\n>Abrego Garcia\u2019s family has had no contact with him since he was sent to the megaprison in El Salvador, known as CECOT. His wife spotted her husband in news photographs released by Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele on the morning of March 16, after a U.S. district judge had told the Trump administration to halt the flights.\n\n> **\u201cOopsie,\u201d Bukele wrote on social media, taunting the judge.**\n\n>Abrego Garcia\u2019s wife recognized her husband\u2019s decorative arm tattoo and scars, according to the court filing. The image showed Salvadoran guards in black ski masks frog-marching him into the prison, with his head shoved down toward the floor. CECOT is the same prison that Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited last week, recording videos for social media while standing in front of a cell packed with silent detainees.\n\n>If the government wants to deport someone with protected status, the standard course would be to reopen the case and introduce new evidence arguing for deportation. The deportation of a protected-status holder has even stunned some government attorneys I\u2019ve been in touch with who are tracking the case, who declined to be named because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak to the press. \u201cWhat. The. Fuck,\u201d one texted me.\n\n>**Sandoval-Moshenberg told the court that he believes Trump officials deported his client \u201cthrough extrajudicial means because they believed that going through the immigration judge process took too long, and they feared that they might not win all of their cases.\u2019\u2019**",

We aren\u2019t far from the final solution at this point. Every alarm should be going off, it won\u2019t just be limited to brown people for long, it\u2019ll slowly get worse and worse, until it comes for YOU.",
