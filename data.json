The reason the doctors prefer to do a mastectomy is because it's easy to miss some cancer cells doing a lumpectomy and then the cancer can return. Sure enough, they missed some and the cancer came roaring back. Only this time it spread well beyond her breasts, and by the time they realized it was back it had spread to inoperable areas. She has to do a monthly chemo pill to keep it under control and is constantly having to chase the newest treatment once hers stops working. Recently her hair all fell out, after decades of hanging on. We are very lucky to still have her after 20 years post diagnosis, but this cancer will kill her. She is only in her early 60's. We should have another 20 years with her but I don't think she will be able to beat the cancer for that long given her recent decline. United healthcare gave her a death sentence years ago and we just keep trying to postpone it. She could have gone into remission, but instead she's had to live with cancer for decades and will die prematurely from it. We need single payer healthcare in this country YESTERDAY."

It's a powerful position, and for any cardinal electors who may be turned off by his American nationality, it's not his only one. Prevost is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Peru, where he served for many years.\n\n> Overall, **he's considered a centrist**, but on many social issues he's seen as progressive, embracing marginalized groups like Francis, who championed migrants and the poor. But Prevost opposes ordaining women as deacons, for instance, so he's seen as conservative on church doctrine.\n\n> His age could also be a factor \u2014 at 69 some may consider him too young to hold the church's highest office.",

They are full force hitting or kicking the front doors several times often until someone opens the door before they run. I live in a split level so they would also pound on the ground floor windows. \n\nWe basically staged a stake out one night. Saw them coming and called the cops. They got caught and we don't get \"ding dong ditched* anymore. \n\nThey're lucky we don't own any guns. I can 100% see these kids getting shot. It was terrifying.",

I have no idea what the viral tik Tok challenge is specifically, but these kids kicked in his storm door. Like he had to replace it. Then a month later, attempted to do it again. This time he was prepared, and proceeded to tackle one of the kids, and sat on him til the police arrived. He was furious and saw only red, and if they were a touch older, I wouldn't have been surprised for him to have pummelled them. They were 10 years old, and I think that was their saving grace. All these kids need to knock it off. Loss of life here is tragic. A lot of people are on edge these days, and I'm not surprised this happened. Terrible outcome",
                "\"The shooting happened around 3 a.m. Saturday, the Spotsylvania County Sheriff\u2019s Office said in a news release. Deputies were sent to a home near McKenzie Lane in the Washington, D.C., suburb following a call for a residential burglary in progress, in which a resident had fired shots.\n\nBosworth and another person had gunshot wounds, the sheriff's office said. Bosworth was taken to the hospital, where he died from his injuries. The other person, a juvenile, was treated and released. A third juvenile with them was unharmed, authorities said.\n\nButler, 27, told investigators that he believed the teens were trying to break into his home, NBC Washington reported.\n\nAccording to a search warrant affidavit obtained by NBC News, one of the teens told detectives that they were recording ding-dong ditch pranks for a TikTok video, in which they ring people's doorbells and then run away. The teen said that they had been to a couple of homes in the neighborhood and that he was not familiar with the area.\"\n\nAt 3am? They decide it's a good idea to ring people's doorbells? Not saying they should have been shot but how dumb can people be???",
                "I remember playing ding dong ditch as a kid with some friends. Lived in a country area where homes were further apart. One of the homeowners fired a few shots off after we had ditched their home and were running away. We didn\u2019t know if it was at us or in the air, but we def stopped playing after that day.",

                "I have weird military-related PTSD that triggers when unexpected people come to my house. \n\nI\u2019m ashamed to say I yelled at an old Jehova\u2019s Witness woman once for coming back after I told her not to. The unadulterated pure white-hot panic I feel when a loud knock hits my front door gives me days of depression. \n\nSo\u2026 I get it. You don\u2019t know what battles people fight in their private homes.",
                "to give some context this \"prank\" is common here where i live. this isn't simple ding dong ditch you guys simplify it. \n\nwhen it happened to us it was a group of four teens they rotated running  up to the door and kicking it. they know about the ring cameras and they know how to evade them. i was woken up at 3am with kids upstairs and my fight or flight kicked in guys. you don't have time to look on your ring. \n\nsometimes they also ring the doorbell but again many of these kids don't want to be identified so they cover their faces. again looking like a burglar. \n\ni'm not condoning the shooting i'm just setting some context for people to process what happened on both sides. \n\nit has shaken me and my family up. it's been almost a year and i still get ptsd and we have to check all the doors are locked constantly in what you would consider a safe suburb. \n\nit's not just a prank."

It's a powerful position, and for any cardinal electors who may be turned off by his American nationality, it's not his only one. Prevost is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Peru, where he served for many years.\n\n> Overall, **he's considered a centrist**, but on many social issues he's seen as progressive, embracing marginalized groups like Francis, who championed migrants and the poor. But Prevost opposes ordaining women as deacons, for instance, so he's seen as conservative on church doctrine.\n\n> His age could also be a factor \u2014 at 69 some may consider him too young to hold the church's highest office.",

                "Papal names are often chosen for a reason or to send a message, so it's good to look at what other popes with that name did, as it can often give a hint at the new pope's views. In this case, Leo XIII was famous for issuing one of the Catholic Church's most famous edicts, ***Rerum novarum***, which criticized capitalism for its tendency toward greed, concentration of wealth, and mistreatment of workers. It strongly advocated for organizations like labor unions. At the same time, it also criticized socialism for rejecting private property and the under-emphasis of the importance of the individual.",
                "For those wondering, it's sort of a continuation of the previous Pope's idealogical leanings - champions the poor/migrants but is against ordaining women. He's also a dual US-Peru citizen."
