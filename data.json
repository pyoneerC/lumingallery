They are buying the genetic database to use in the development of new monoclonal antibody therapeutic proteins.  There is an arms race to get to good candidates first to stake out patents to prevent competitors access to whole categories of potential therapies. They have lost several lawsuits to others who got there first metaphorically speaking.  They have technology to rapidly test candidates with Velocogene and could theoretically get dozens of billion dollar drugs from this dataset without any patent fights. The money spent is peanuts to its potential value.  While I am not a huge fan of the cost of these therapies , I personally know the tens to hundreds of thousands of man hours that go into developing these drugs, and they can be astonishingly effective.  It\u2019s not popular to say you worked in big pharma but I\u2019m very proud of the work I did there and how it has affected patients, including members of my own extended family.",

Otherwise, I wouldn't do this.",

This is a legitimate big pharmaceutical company who has a lot of R&D around genetic disease and has made a lot of therapeutic advances. They want the data to develop new therapies, probably ones for genetic based disease. Being the first to do this will make them so much money. That\u2019s their goal here, I think. It\u2019s new massively growing space in R&D. And this much genetic data is research treasure trove for them.\n\nThey are also going to have pre-designed protocols and standards when it comes to handling this data. I know people side eye big pharma (rightfully in most circumstances) but this is a much better outcome than many other situations.\n\nAm I saying don\u2019t delete your data? No. Am I saying this is better than pretty much any other potential buyer? Absolutely.\n\nI also want to add one thing: All the stuff about Trump ties is wild. Pretty much every pharma company (and  many of the academic researchers that Trump is now black listing from NIH funding due to their coronavirus research) got Project Warp Speed funding during the pandemic. Monoclonal antibody treatment was an absolute scientific miracle. So were the other rapid vaccine developments during the pandemic. It saved so many lives.",
