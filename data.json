This was the battle in late November 1959 when the Chinese surprised the US military by entering into the war on North Korea\u2019s side.

Rangel defeated Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. in 1970 who was a legend in the community but by the time the mid-60s came around, he had all but checked out of the job and was under investigation for misusing public money. And he was spending more time in his second home in Bimini than Washington or New York. And Rangel became a legend in his own right but probably stayed too long as well before finally retiring in 2017.",

Investigators eventually got a match after Hardin was imprisoned for Appleton's killing.\n\nMurders someone, then his DNA sample during processing matches a rape case.\n\nWinning through and through.",
                "Hardin pleaded guilty in October 2017 to first-degree murder in connection with the shooting death of 59-year-old James Appleton. According to an affidavit filed in the case, Appleton worked for the Gateway water department and was talking to his brother-in-law, then-Gateway Mayor Andrew Tillman, when he was shot in the head on Feb. 23, 2017, near Garfield. Police found Appleton's body inside a car.",

                "What's with all the prison breaks that have been happening lately? Have there actually been more of them, or is the news just reporting on them because they're trending? Or is the *Prison Break* reboot going hard with its marketing?",
                "I bet he had inside help.",
                "Wouldn't he have been out of genpop for being a former cop anyway? How he escaped has to either be a serious fuck up or extremely daring.",
                "he likely just knew the layout and knew exactly what was needed to go with no fuss. \n\ni worked in a psych ward for a few years and realize im not exempt to being subjected to a place like this if i decided on a whim that i was done. if i had landed in the facility i worked i'd probably beg them not to take me to this particular place, mostly out of embarrassment, specifically telling them that i know the entire layout and how to get out if i needed to. this highlights the flaw in the system. if i told them this en route, they wouldnt care. its not their problem. the intake department might have some concerns, but the facility manager would likely pass it off as some random manic episode. they certainly wouldnt check records, because the paycheck of holding someone is the single most important factor for them.\n\ni left that job btw, because someone on another unit successfully committed suicide on their watch. this is literally the most important part of our job, but they wanted to cut corners, and go against doctors orders to save a few dollars. the only positive takeaway i have from the entire situation that it wasnt my unit. i only heard things. never interacted with the individual myself...",
