                "> Prior to 1990, separate men\u2019s championships were held, but since then, fencing has been a coed sport with teams having men\u2019s and women\u2019s squads, although some schools field only a women\u2019s team. Fencing is a single-division sport with schools from all three NCAA divisions competing against each other.\n\nHere\u2019s some facts for all the morons talking about the \u201cbiological advantage\u201d men have in fencing. It\u2019s been a coed sport at the national competition level for nearly FOURTY YEARS. This is nothing but more conservative performative outrage, and your excuses is what encourage this kind of behavior.",

They couldn't be bothered to even look up what the policy was apparently, or provide information around why USA fencing felt that policy was actually ok.\n\nThis article comes across as, \"Hey I'm some dude and I want to poke women with my sword.\" Not, \"I identify as a woman and I've been on HRT for 12 months and because of that have lost most of my muscle tone.\" I'd even think it was great if they explained the counterpoint as well which is that most of the physical advantage of men comes from their height which is something they gain in puberty.\n\nI know this is a challenging topic for a lot of people, but holy fuck mainstream journalism is garbage.\n\n  \nedit: This is not an endorsement of alt-media (which is nothing but a sewage plant).

                "Reading the comments have been mind blowing as someone who used to compete in fencing. \n\nIn my experience, gender absolutely made a difference. For reference, I couldn't even score a hit against some of the best men's junior Olympic fencers. But I won scoring wrist flicks back to back against some of the top female fencers for the junior leagues in the country.\n\nBut I absolutely wouldn't be surprised if the disqualified athlete has conservative ideals and their refusal to compete had performative and metaphoric reasons. \n\nBut can we please not speak beyond our lived experiences? It's very weird to read people who have never fenced, or have fenced a little bit say the sport is entirely technique. In my experience, this isn't the case and I'm quite confident some of the best fencers I knew for both male and female divisions would not perform the same competing against each other.",

Specifically in the Division IA Women's Foil, I don't see Sullivan's name in any other event.  \n\nSullivan ended up 24th out of 39, with Turner being 39th as DNF.\n\nIf Sullivan had an advantage, it appears to have been marginal at best.  If you are worried about the 'Majesty of competition', I should note that it does not appear the national news gave a damn about this competition until there was culture war content to be made out of the proceedings."

It's very weird to read people who have never fenced, or have fenced a little bit say the sport is entirely technique.

But I won scoring wrist flicks back to back against some of the top female fencers for the junior leagues in the country.\n\nBut I absolutely wouldn't be surprised if the disqualified athlete has conservative ideals and their refusal to compete had performative and metaphoric reasons. \n\nBut can we please not speak beyond our lived experiences? It's very weird to read people who have never fenced, or have fenced a little bit say the sport is entirely technique. In my experience, this isn't the case and I'm quite confident some of the best fencers I knew for both male and female divisions would not perform the same competing against each other.",

If you are worried about the 'Majesty of competition', I should note that it does not appear the national news gave a damn about this competition until there was culture war content to be made out of the proceedings."
