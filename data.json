If you rush into charging someone, you risk going to court unprepared. Because if you charge, you have a set amount of time before you have to go to court. If you go to court unprepared, you risk losing the case and these jackasses walk. Toxicology takes time. You have to interview witnesses. There\u2019s a LOT to consider. You wait until you believe your case is bulletproof, or at least your chance of winning is maxed out, then you charge.\n\nJust as a fraud investigator, I see a shit ton of cases where \u201cthat\u2019s motherfucker is obviously guilty,\u201d and the case drags on before charges are brought. I\u2019ve worked on stuff that\u2019s literally gone on for five years. It\u2019s not usually on the police. The AGs or AUSAs that don\u2019t want to take on a case where there\u2019s a higher chance of losing.\n\nThe other side of this is that it\u2019s almost certainly going to get pled down to something like reckless endangerment or whatever and these guys will do two years or something. They charged the highest thing they could upfront to get pressure and a headline.",
