He was taken into custody with non-life-threatening injuries, multiple law enforcement officials told ABC News.\n\nIkner is the son of a current Leon County sheriff's deputy, according to Sheriff Walter McNeil. He had access to one of his mother's personal weapons, which was one of the weapons found at the scene, the sheriff said.
