                "#\"Zombie Deer Disease\" is No Joke\n## \u2013 and Scientists are Worried\n\nA strange and deadly disease is creeping through America\u2019s deer, elk and moose, spreading its grip from state to state and even crossing international borders. It is officially known as chronic wasting disease, or CWD, but in the media, it has earned a more lurid nickname: zombie deer disease. The label comes from its eerie symptoms, drooling, vacant stares, dramatic weight loss and animals staggering around in a disoriented daze. But scientists say the nickname is misleading and dangerously trivialises what could turn into a global crisis.\n\nCWD is always fatal and has no cure. First detected in wild deer in Colorado and Wyoming in 1981, it has since spread across 36 American states and beyond, reaching Canada, Scandinavia and South Korea. The disease is caused not by bacteria or a virus but by prions, rogue proteins that infect the brain, causing a slow but unstoppable decline. Once these prions are in the environment, they linger for years, infecting new animals through soil, water and even plants.\n\nFor now, there has been no confirmed case of CWD jumping to humans, but that does not mean the danger is not there. Scientists remember all too well what happened with BSE, or mad cow disease, which took years to leap to people, with tragic consequences. **Experts are warning that CWD could be following a similar path, particularly as thousands of people regularly eat venison from infected deer without realising it.**\n\nMichael Osterholm, an epidemiologist who has been sounding the alarm for years, says the risk is growing, yet governments are not taking it seriously enough. A recent report from 67 experts painted a bleak picture of what would happen if the disease spilt over to humans, predicting chaos in global food supplies, agriculture and trade, not to mention a major public health disaster. Despite this, surveillance and research funding are being cut just when they are needed most.\n\nSome states are making the situation worse. In Wyoming, for example, large numbers of elk and deer are fed artificial food in winter to keep their populations high. Scientists say this is a recipe for disaster, bringing animals into close contact and making it easy for the disease to spread. Meanwhile, predators like wolves and mountain lions, which naturally target sick animals and help control the spread of CWD, are being aggressively culled.\n\nIt is not just scientists who are concerned. Hunters, many of whom rely on venison as a key part of their diet, are beginning to worry about the safety of their food. Yet many deer shot by hunters are never tested for CWD, and contaminated meat is being transported across state lines, increasing the risk of further spread. In some places, infected carcasses are even being dumped in landfill sites, raising fears that the disease could find new ways to take hold in the environment.\n\nThere are no easy solutions, but ignoring the problem is not one of them. Without action, experts warn that entire populations of deer and elk could be wiped out over time. The best way to slow the disease is to let nature take its course, allow predators to do their job and stop artificially feeding wild animals in ways that help CWD thrive.\n\nScientists are watching anxiously, knowing that if CWD ever does jump to humans, the world could be facing another crisis that no one saw coming. For now, all they can do is keep warning people, even if too many are still not listening."

The label comes from its eerie symptoms, drooling, vacant stares, dramatic weight loss and animals staggering around in a disoriented daze. But scientists say the nickname is misleading and dangerously trivialises what could turn into a global crisis.\n\nCWD is always fatal and has no cure. First detected in wild deer in Colorado and Wyoming in 1981, it has since spread across 36 American states and beyond, reaching Canada, Scandinavia and South Korea. The disease is caused not by bacteria or a virus but by prions, rogue proteins that infect the brain, causing a slow but unstoppable decline. Once these prions are in the environment, they linger for years, infecting new animals through soil, water and even plants.\n\nFor now, there has been no confirmed case of CWD jumping to humans, but that does not mean the danger is not there. Scientists remember all too well what happened with BSE, or mad cow disease, which took years to leap to people, with tragic consequences. **Experts are warning that CWD could be following a similar path, particularly as thousands of people regularly eat venison from infected deer without realising it.**\n\nMichael Osterholm, an epidemiologist who has been sounding the alarm for years, says the risk is growing, yet governments are not taking it seriously enough. A recent report from 67 experts painted a bleak picture of what would happen if the disease spilt over to humans, predicting chaos in global food supplies, agriculture and trade, not to mention a major public health disaster. Despite this, surveillance and research funding are being cut just when they are needed most.\n\nSome states are making the situation worse. In Wyoming, for example, large numbers of elk and deer are fed artificial food in winter to keep their populations high. Scientists say this is a recipe for disaster, bringing animals into close contact and making it easy for the disease to spread. Meanwhile, predators like wolves and mountain lions, which naturally target sick animals and help control the spread of CWD, are being aggressively culled.\n\nIt is not just scientists who are concerned. Hunters, many of whom rely on venison as a key part of their diet, are beginning to worry about the safety of their food. Yet many deer shot by hunters are never tested for CWD, and contaminated meat is being transported across state lines, increasing the risk of further spread. In some places, infected carcasses are even being dumped in landfill sites, raising fears that the disease could find new ways to take hold in the environment.\n\nThere are no easy solutions, but ignoring the problem is not one of them. Without action, experts warn that entire populations of deer and elk could be wiped out over time. The best way to slow the disease is to let nature take its course, allow predators to do their job and stop artificially feeding wild animals in ways that help CWD thrive.\n\nScientists are watching anxiously, knowing that if CWD ever does jump to humans, the world could be facing another crisis that no one saw coming. For now, all they can do is keep warning people, even if too many are still not listening."

                "#\"Zombie Deer Disease\" is No Joke\n## \u2013 and Scientists are Worried\n\nA strange and deadly disease is creeping through America\u2019s deer, elk and moose, spreading its grip from state to state and even crossing international borders. It is officially known as chronic wasting disease, or CWD, but in the media, it has earned a more lurid nickname: zombie deer disease. The label comes from its eerie symptoms, drooling, vacant stares, dramatic weight loss and animals staggering around in a disoriented daze. But scientists say the nickname is misleading and dangerously trivialises what could turn into a global crisis.\n\nCWD is always fatal and has no cure. First detected in wild deer in Colorado and Wyoming in 1981, it has since spread across 36 American states and beyond, reaching Canada, Scandinavia and South Korea. The disease is caused not by bacteria or a virus but by prions, rogue proteins that infect the brain, causing a slow but unstoppable decline. Once these prions are in the environment, they linger for years, infecting new animals through soil, water and even plants.\n\nFor now, there has been no confirmed case of CWD jumping to humans, but that does not mean the danger is not there. Scientists remember all too well what happened with BSE, or mad cow disease, which took years to leap to people, with tragic consequences. **Experts are warning that CWD could be following a similar path, particularly as thousands of people regularly eat venison from infected deer without realising it.**\n\nMichael Osterholm, an epidemiologist who has been sounding the alarm for years, says the risk is growing, yet governments are not taking it seriously enough. A recent report from 67 experts painted a bleak picture of what would happen if the disease spilt over to humans, predicting chaos in global food supplies, agriculture and trade, not to mention a major public health disaster. Despite this, surveillance and research funding are being cut just when they are needed most.\n\nSome states are making the situation worse. In Wyoming, for example, large numbers of elk and deer are fed artificial food in winter to keep their populations high. Scientists say this is a recipe for disaster, bringing animals into close contact and making it easy for the disease to spread. Meanwhile, predators like wolves and mountain lions, which naturally target sick animals and help control the spread of CWD, are being aggressively culled.\n\nIt is not just scientists who are concerned. Hunters, many of whom rely on venison as a key part of their diet, are beginning to worry about the safety of their food. Yet many deer shot by hunters are never tested for CWD, and contaminated meat is being transported across state lines, increasing the risk of further spread. In some places, infected carcasses are even being dumped in landfill sites, raising fears that the disease could find new ways to take hold in the environment.\n\nThere are no easy solutions, but ignoring the problem is not one of them. Without action, experts warn that entire populations of deer and elk could be wiped out over time. The best way to slow the disease is to let nature take its course, allow predators to do their job and stop artificially feeding wild animals in ways that help CWD thrive.\n\nScientists are watching anxiously, knowing that if CWD ever does jump to humans, the world could be facing another crisis that no one saw coming. For now, all they can do is keep warning people, even if too many are still not listening."
