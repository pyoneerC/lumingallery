You can cancel out of the power off screen.)\n\nPolice will ask for your passcode so they can fish for evidence of illegal activity, snoop around your private photos and posts, get a list of your friends on social media, install stuff on your phone, or make a copy of its contents.

Don't be shocked when you vote for leopards, and then they eat your face.",
                "Just as a reminder to everyone, if you are a citizen of the United States, you cannot be denied entry at the border once you have shown proof of such. You are, legally, guaranteed that right. You can of course be detained after admission, but then standard warrant rules and such apply.\n\nIn other words, what this article describes was completely illegal. I know I know, take a number, but still. Important to call it out.",
                "In a prior story about this guy, he mentioned that he expected things to improve under President Trump. Reap what you sow, buddy. \n https://www.nbcboston.com/news/politics/treated-like-a-criminal-us-citizen-says-he-was-detained-returning-from-canada/3686188/",

                "\"While detained, Atallah said he gave CBP agents the passcode to his phone after they asked for it.\"\n\nYou should never give up your phone's passcode. Moreover, if you believe your iPhone is going to be taken away from you, click the lock button five times or hold the lock + volume up buttons down for a few seconds; this brings up the \"slide to power off\" screen but more importantly it disables biometrics (Face ID / Touch ID) until you enter the passcode once, so whoever takes the phone from you can't then unlock it by just holding it up to your face. (Try it now so you see how it works before you need it. You can cancel out of the power off screen.)\n\nPolice will ask for your passcode so they can fish for evidence of illegal activity, snoop around your private photos and posts, get a list of your friends on social media, install stuff on your phone, or make a copy of its contents. Just like nothing you say to a cop will talk him out of arresting you, giving a cop your phone's passcode isn't going to let him look through your phone and then decide to release you.",

I got grilled totally unnecessarily (coming back into the US) last October with a rented car. The US agent was just a total jerk to me, and that's the truth. And that was in October. That feels like a different lifetime.\n\nI think my next trip back to Canada will be in the air. I'm just about done with land borders. It used to be it was an after thought to pass through a land border.  Not anymore. I completely empathize with anyone who isn't white crossing the border these days. I mean I'm nervous myself. I can't even imagine how scared they must be.\n\nAll of this is so ridiculous. I didn't vote for Trump and I knew it would be a shit show if he got elected. But. this is 1000x worse than I had feared. And I am predicting it gets way way worse yet.",

He told CNN after his and wife\u2019s treatment last week, he\u2019s worried about returning to the U.S.\n\n>\u201cI hope they don\u2019t retaliate because I\u2019m speaking out,\u201d Atallah said.\n\n  \nReally worried for this guy. CBP has become so evil. Threatening a man by grabbing at your gun because he asked why he's being detained? what the fuck?"
