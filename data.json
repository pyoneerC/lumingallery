So far, only Tift District Attorney Patrick Warren has answered and said typically miscarriages are not handled in this manner.*\"\n\nSo they asked what she was supposed to do with the fetus and nobody had an answer.  If you can't tell her what she did wrong, why was she arrested?  Just because she probably didn't have a healthcare plan that would pay for it?",

I mean... it's a miscarriage.  Did they want her to keep it in the fridge until the damn coroner can pick it up or something? Geeze! It's already traumatizing enough.",

Women miscarrying get turned away from hospitals because doctors are afraid to be accused of performing abortions. Maybe she didn\u2019t even have the money to afford the ER visit (a whole other issue about how shitty the US is about healthcare).\n\nLook, I\u2019ll be real with you. I used to work with animal control. Laws are different in different places, but when we had dead animals the law was two trash bags, into the dumpster. Trash bag/dumpster seems better to me than flushing it down the toilet. Burying it in the yard like a dead pet? If there are no laws regarding this, Tifton needs to leave this woman alone.",
