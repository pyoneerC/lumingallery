Cutting nearly half a department overnight, with barely a warning, is not streamlining, it is sabotage. Even if you believe the Department of Education is bloated, you do not fix a system by gutting it in a way that leaves staff terrified and scrambling. \n\nPeople do not work well under fear, and a government that rules through uncertainty is more interested in control than competence. The bigger question is what comes next. If this is just the warm-up act for dismantling the department altogether, what does that mean for the millions of students and families who rely on federal education programmes? Anyone cheering this move might want to ask themselves whether they trust their local politicians to handle education funding fairly and effectively because that is where this is headed.",

Four of the men allegedly filmed the scenes of them sexually assaulting their biological or foster daughters, aged between 6 and 14 at the time, and shared the footage within a social media group, while the other three owned obscene images of underage individuals.\n\nIn the messaging app used by the group, there were comments reading, \"I've trained her since she was 3,\" \"Just telling her, 'If you tell your mom, you wouldn't be able to be with your dad. Can you keep a secret?' worked for me,\" and, \"Because my wife is away on a trip.\" The prefectural police believe that the men continued to sexually abuse their own daughters and others on a regular basis.\n\nIn November last year, one of the men was arrested on suspicion of penetrative sexual assault of an underage person, and a probe of his mobile phone revealed that the group was sharing obscene videos.\n\nIt is thought that the group, comprised of men fond of incest with minors, started exchanging information in around December 2023.
