It's a powerful position, and for any cardinal electors who may be turned off by his American nationality, it's not his only one. Prevost is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Peru, where he served for many years.\n\n> Overall, **he's considered a centrist**, but on many social issues he's seen as progressive, embracing marginalized groups like Francis, who championed migrants and the poor. But Prevost opposes ordaining women as deacons, for instance, so he's seen as conservative on church doctrine.\n\n> His age could also be a factor \u2014 at 69 some may consider him too young to hold the church's highest office.",

In this case, Leo XIII was famous for issuing one of the Catholic Church's most famous edicts, ***Rerum novarum***, which criticized capitalism for its tendency toward greed, concentration of wealth, and mistreatment of workers. It strongly advocated for organizations like labor unions. At the same time, it also criticized socialism for rejecting private property and the under-emphasis of the importance of the individual."

In this case, Leo XIII was famous for issuing one of the Catholic Church's most famous edicts, ***Rerum novarum***, which criticized capitalism for its tendency toward greed, concentration of wealth, and mistreatment of workers. It strongly advocated for organizations like labor unions. At the same time, it also criticized socialism for rejecting private property and the under-emphasis of the importance of the individual."

I have no idea what the viral tik Tok challenge is specifically, but these kids kicked in his storm door. Like he had to replace it. Then a month later, attempted to do it again. This time he was prepared, and proceeded to tackle one of the kids, and sat on him til the police arrived. He was furious and saw only red, and if they were a touch older, I wouldn't have been surprised for him to have pummelled them. They were 10 years old, and I think that was their saving grace.

Deputies were sent to a home near McKenzie Lane in the Washington, D.C., suburb following a call for a residential burglary in progress, in which a resident had fired shots.\n\nBosworth and another person had gunshot wounds, the sheriff's office said. Bosworth was taken to the hospital, where he died from his injuries. The other person, a juvenile, was treated and released. A third juvenile with them was unharmed, authorities said.\n\nButler, 27, told investigators that he believed the teens were trying to break into his home, NBC Washington reported.\n\nAccording to a search warrant affidavit obtained by NBC News, one of the teens told detectives that they were recording ding-dong ditch pranks for a TikTok video, in which they ring people's doorbells and then run away. The teen said that they had been to a couple of homes in the neighborhood and that he was not familiar with the area.\"\n\nAt 3am? They decide it's a good idea to ring people's doorbells? Not saying they should have been shot but how dumb can people be???",

One of the homeowners fired a few shots off after we had ditched their home and were running away. We didn\u2019t know if it was at us or in the air, but we def stopped playing after that day.",
