                "> Mr. Mahdawi has not been accused of a crime. According to his lawyers, the Trump administration appears to be seeking his removal from the country under the same legal provision that it is using to detain another recent Columbia student and Palestinian, Mahmoud Khalil, contending that his presence is a threat to the foreign policy and national security interests of the United States. Immigration officials have argued that pro-Palestinian demonstrators have enabled the spread of antisemitism, but they have not offered evidence to substantiate the claim.\n\nThis is the real issue. Rubio can just say this guy\u2019s presence harms our foreign policy agenda and SCOTUS has already said a judge can\u2019t overrule that or challenge it in any way, despite Rubio not presenting any evidence to support it. \n\nSo, once again, if the government says you\u2019re a terrorist, they can deport you without any evidence of that, and ~~SCOTUS has affirmed that somehow that\u2019s legal and constitutional!~~\n\nEDIT: Clarifying one point (corrected above) - SCOTUS has not (yet) ruled on Khalil\u2019s case, that was a judge in Louisiana. That ruling is in the process of being appealed.",

Whether they have strong causative links like HPV and cervical cancer is up for debate, IE it may not be primarily causative, but increases susceptibility to them. especially if there are environmental factors within the work environment that raise risks. \n\nFunnily, sometimes you can use viral infections to fight cancers. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is sometimes an infection to be found in brain tumors, but not in the surrounding non-tumor brain tissues (IE healthy ones).  So, if you can turn your immune system against CMV, you can by proxy target brain tumors (Glioblastomas specifically). And it turns out that most adults (40+) are CMV+. It's just that CMV is usually quite benign in adults so no one really pays attention to it.\n\n  \nBut the odds of 6 people getting tumors is quite odds-defying.

                "There are cancer-associated viral infections like Epstein-Barr (EBV). Whether they have strong causative links like HPV and cervical cancer is up for debate, IE it may not be primarily causative, but increases susceptibility to them. especially if there are environmental factors within the work environment that raise risks. \n\nFunnily, sometimes you can use viral infections to fight cancers. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is sometimes an infection to be found in brain tumors, but not in the surrounding non-tumor brain tissues (IE healthy ones).  So, if you can turn your immune system against CMV, you can by proxy target brain tumors (Glioblastomas specifically). And it turns out that most adults (40+) are CMV+. It's just that CMV is usually quite benign in adults so no one really pays attention to it.\n\n  \nBut the odds of 6 people getting tumors is quite odds-defying. Public/Occupational health really ought to take a look at the workplace.",

I calibrate those machines monthly with the same gas so I took note to take more precautions with it. \n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1896112621000146\n\nLike I mentioned, just a dumb biomed, but medically nitric oxide is used in conjunction with medical ventilation. The extra gas helps the cardiopulmonary system accept/regulate? oxygen. The machines are also used on adult patients with severe heart issues."
