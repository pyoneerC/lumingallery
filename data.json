One said Holmberg gave him money to film sex acts in the 1990s. The other man who spoke at the hearing was a cooperating witness who said Holmberg used his political power to groom them for sex. \n\n* Holmberg said in court that he traveled to Prague with the intent of having sexual contact with minors, that he liked massages and some involved sexual contact. He said he might have received a sexual massage from someone under 18, but he\u2019s not sure.\n\n* In one message, Holmberg sent a cooperating witness a link to a brothel in Prague with the comment, \u201cThe boys rent at around $60 \u2026 (sex is extra).\u201d\n\n* Holmberg was linked to the investigation of Nicholas Morgan-Derosier, a Grand Forks man who was sentenced in May to 40 years on child pornography charges.\n\n* Holmberg, a Republican who held the powerful positions of Senate Appropriations Committee chair and head of Legislative Management, resigned from the Legislature in 2022. He was indicted on federal charges in October 2023.\n\n* Ray Holmberg, 81, was a Grand Forks state senator for 45 years, and received a sentence that is longer than federal sentencing guidelines. \n\n* U.S. District Judge Daniel Hovland characterized Holmberg\u2019s conduct as \u201cegregious and despicable\u201d and said he didn\u2019t think the guideline sentence of more than three years was adequate.\n\n* \u201cFrom my perspective, this was not an isolated case and this is not a victimless crime,\u201d Hovland said. \u201cIt displays a pattern of very vile, sickening criminal behavior.\u201d\n\n* Holmberg was sentenced to *10* years. At age 81, it's likely he will die in prison.\n\n* Holmberg is not trans nor a drag queen.",

One said Holmberg gave him money to film sex acts in the 1990s. The other man who spoke at the hearing was a cooperating witness who said Holmberg used his political power to groom them for sex. \n\n* Holmberg said in court that he traveled to Prague with the intent of having sexual contact with minors, that he liked massages and some involved sexual contact. He said he might have received a sexual massage from someone under 18, but he\u2019s not sure.\n\n* In one message, Holmberg sent a cooperating witness a link to a brothel in Prague with the comment, \u201cThe boys rent at around $60 \u2026 (sex is extra).\u201d\n\n* Holmberg was linked to the investigation of Nicholas Morgan-Derosier, a Grand Forks man who was sentenced in May to 40 years on child pornography charges.\n\n* Holmberg, a Republican who held the powerful positions of Senate Appropriations Committee chair and head of Legislative Management, resigned from the Legislature in 2022. He was indicted on federal charges in October 2023.\n\n* Ray Holmberg, 81, was a Grand Forks state senator for 45 years, and received a sentence that is longer than federal sentencing guidelines. \n\n* U.S. District Judge Daniel Hovland characterized Holmberg\u2019s conduct as \u201cegregious and despicable\u201d and said he didn\u2019t think the guideline sentence of more than three years was adequate.\n\n* \u201cFrom my perspective, this was not an isolated case and this is not a victimless crime,\u201d Hovland said. \u201cIt displays a pattern of very vile, sickening criminal behavior.\u201d\n\n* Holmberg was sentenced to *10* years.

                "Oh I get it now. This is to curb inflation. See\u2026 if copper is expensive then pennies can buy more goods. There are 100 pennies in a dollar, so that must be true for paper dollars too. and boom national debt is gone! \n\nThere is the plan folks!",
                "#Copper\u2019s on Fire as Trump Tariff Talk Sparks Record-Breaking Price Surge\n\nCopper, usually the quieter cousin to gold in the metals world, has suddenly stolen the spotlight. Prices for the red metal have rocketed to an all-time high in New York, fuelled by whispers that President Donald Trump may slap tariffs on copper imports far sooner than markets had expected.\n\nTraders had been banking on autumn for any big changes, but reports on Wednesday suggested tariffs might land within weeks. That was all the spark Wall Street needed. Copper futures leapt to an eye-watering $5.374 per pound before cooling slightly to settle at $5.24, still a record. For context, copper has surged 30 per cent this year alone, outpacing even gold, which is having a strong year itself. The stock markets, meanwhile, are still playing catch-up.\n\nThe surge is being driven less by traditional demand and more by panic buying. US firms, anxious to get ahead of any new import charges, are snapping up copper as quickly as they can. Analysts believe around 500,000 tons are being shipped to American ports this month, a massive jump from the usual 70,000 tons. Goldman Sachs thinks that figure could rise by another 200,000 tons in April.\n\nIt\u2019s a classic case of buy now, worry later. Traders are front-running the tariffs, trying to stockpile before prices go even higher. As one analyst put it, the mere suggestion of tariffs has sent copper into a frenzy. The result is a growing gap between copper prices in New York and London, where the metal has also climbed but not nearly as dramatically.\n\nCopper may not be classed as a rare earth mineral, nor does it feature among the US\u2019s 50 \u201ccritical minerals\u201d, but it remains vital. It is used everywhere from electronics to energy systems to national defence. The US Department of Energy even called it a \u201ccritical material for energy\u201d back in 2023. With such wide-ranging uses, any disruption to supply has ripple effects.\n\nInterestingly, this price spike is not being driven by ordinary consumer demand. It is more about shifting stockpiles and geopolitical chess moves. Trump recently signed an executive order to investigate the national security risks of importing copper, a move that many see as paving the way for yet another tariff.\n\nThe frenzy is already having global consequences. Analysts warn that the US copper grab could leave other countries short, and with the world expected to meet only 70 per cent of copper demand by 2035, that is a real concern. Throw in a recent production cut from Glencore in Chile, and the copper market looks increasingly tight.\n\nDespite the buzz, not everyone is convinced the price surge will last. Once the stockpiling rush subsides, we may see a correction. But for now, copper is having its moment, and the markets are watching every move from the White House with bated breath.",

                "#Copper\u2019s on Fire as Trump Tariff Talk Sparks Record-Breaking Price Surge\n\nCopper, usually the quieter cousin to gold in the metals world, has suddenly stolen the spotlight. Prices for the red metal have rocketed to an all-time high in New York, fuelled by whispers that President Donald Trump may slap tariffs on copper imports far sooner than markets had expected.\n\nTraders had been banking on autumn for any big changes, but reports on Wednesday suggested tariffs might land within weeks. That was all the spark Wall Street needed. Copper futures leapt to an eye-watering $5.374 per pound before cooling slightly to settle at $5.24, still a record. For context, copper has surged 30 per cent this year alone, outpacing even gold, which is having a strong year itself. The stock markets, meanwhile, are still playing catch-up.\n\nThe surge is being driven less by traditional demand and more by panic buying. US firms, anxious to get ahead of any new import charges, are snapping up copper as quickly as they can. Analysts believe around 500,000 tons are being shipped to American ports this month, a massive jump from the usual 70,000 tons. Goldman Sachs thinks that figure could rise by another 200,000 tons in April.\n\nIt\u2019s a classic case of buy now, worry later. Traders are front-running the tariffs, trying to stockpile before prices go even higher. As one analyst put it, the mere suggestion of tariffs has sent copper into a frenzy. The result is a growing gap between copper prices in New York and London, where the metal has also climbed but not nearly as dramatically.\n\nCopper may not be classed as a rare earth mineral, nor does it feature among the US\u2019s 50 \u201ccritical minerals\u201d, but it remains vital. It is used everywhere from electronics to energy systems to national defence. The US Department of Energy even called it a \u201ccritical material for energy\u201d back in 2023. With such wide-ranging uses, any disruption to supply has ripple effects.\n\nInterestingly, this price spike is not being driven by ordinary consumer demand. It is more about shifting stockpiles and geopolitical chess moves. Trump recently signed an executive order to investigate the national security risks of importing copper, a move that many see as paving the way for yet another tariff.\n\nThe frenzy is already having global consequences. Analysts warn that the US copper grab could leave other countries short, and with the world expected to meet only 70 per cent of copper demand by 2035, that is a real concern. Throw in a recent production cut from Glencore in Chile, and the copper market looks increasingly tight.\n\nDespite the buzz, not everyone is convinced the price surge will last. Once the stockpiling rush subsides, we may see a correction. But for now, copper is having its moment, and the markets are watching every move from the White House with bated breath.",
