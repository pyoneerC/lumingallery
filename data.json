Browning argues that most of the men of \u00a0RPB 101 were not fanatical\u00a0Nazis but, rather, ordinary middle-aged, working-class men who committed these atrocities out of a mixture of motives, including the group dynamics of conformity, deference to authority, role adaptation, and the altering of moral norms to justify their actions. Very quickly three groups emerged within the battalion: a core of eager killers, a plurality who carried out their duties reliably but without initiative, and a small minority who evaded participation in the acts of killing without diminishing the murderous efficiency of the battalion whatsoever.\n\n>While this book discusses a specific Reserve Unit during WWII, the general argument Browning makes is that most people succumb to the pressures of a group setting and commit actions they would never do of their own volition. \u00a0\n\n>*Ordinary Men*\u00a0is a powerful, chilling, and important work with themes and arguments that continue to resonate today.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, Orpo must stand for Orlando Police",

A lot of big missiles are ballistic in trajectory, so unlike cruise missiles they don\u2019t change course, only make minor corrections to stay on their trajectory, so very easy to predict. Also, unlike hellfires and TOW missiles they\u2019re not actively guided, as in, receiving targeting updates. You give them a location, say have a blast, and send them on their way.\n\nThe math to avoid is fairly simple.\n\nTake an average ballistic missile, say an Iskander, max speed 2600 m/s. Remembering that max speed is going to be in the terminal, and that from launch to apogee (max ord) it\u2019ll be starting from 0 and gaining speed. Let\u2019s give the missile an average of 1500 m/s.\n\nAssuming the carrier strike group is 30 miles out to see, so, ~45km.\n\n45000 meters assuming a generous average of 1500 meters a second gives us 30 seconds to move the ship from where it was going to be to anywhere else. Even turning hard to simply bleed speed would work to move the 1092 ft long flight deck out of the predicted point of impact. Especially if you turn the ship perpendicular to the flight path now the target zone is only 252 feet wide and increases the likelihood the missile will over or under shoot the target. Artillery and missiles don\u2019t average their impacts in circles, but in ovals with the greatest deviation based on the gun to target line (gtl).\n\nAllllll that said, this is still probably a \u201csomeone fucked up and we\u2019re gonna try to play it off\u201d thing.

                "Ever read Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland  by Christopher Browning?\n\n>\n\n>*Ordinary Men*\u00a0is the true story of Reserve Police Battalion 101 of the German Order Police, which was responsible for mass shootings as well as round-ups of Jewish people for deportation to Nazi death camps in Poland in 1942. Browning argues that most of the men of \u00a0RPB 101 were not fanatical\u00a0Nazis but, rather, ordinary middle-aged, working-class men who committed these atrocities out of a mixture of motives, including the group dynamics of conformity, deference to authority, role adaptation, and the altering of moral norms to justify their actions. Very quickly three groups emerged within the battalion: a core of eager killers, a plurality who carried out their duties reliably but without initiative, and a small minority who evaded participation in the acts of killing without diminishing the murderous efficiency of the battalion whatsoever.\n\n>While this book discusses a specific Reserve Unit during WWII, the general argument Browning makes is that most people succumb to the pressures of a group setting and commit actions they would never do of their own volition. \u00a0\n\n>*Ordinary Men*\u00a0is a powerful, chilling, and important work with themes and arguments that continue to resonate today.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, Orpo must stand for Orlando Police",

The Houthi rebel group claimed on Monday to have launched a drone and missile attack on the aircraft carrier, which is in the Red Sea as part of the US military\u2019s major anti-Houthi operation. \n\nIf a carrier is turning to avoid fire, something is seriously wrong with the battlegroup and the ships that are supposed to be screening. \n\nThis response sounds like BS.",

                "A lot of people are saying you can turn a ship fast enough to avoid a missile, but you really can. A lot of big missiles are ballistic in trajectory, so unlike cruise missiles they don\u2019t change course, only make minor corrections to stay on their trajectory, so very easy to predict. Also, unlike hellfires and TOW missiles they\u2019re not actively guided, as in, receiving targeting updates. You give them a location, say have a blast, and send them on their way.\n\nThe math to avoid is fairly simple.\n\nTake an average ballistic missile, say an Iskander, max speed 2600 m/s. Remembering that max speed is going to be in the terminal, and that from launch to apogee (max ord) it\u2019ll be starting from 0 and gaining speed. Let\u2019s give the missile an average of 1500 m/s.\n\nAssuming the carrier strike group is 30 miles out to see, so, ~45km.\n\n45000 meters assuming a generous average of 1500 meters a second gives us 30 seconds to move the ship from where it was going to be to anywhere else. Even turning hard to simply bleed speed would work to move the 1092 ft long flight deck out of the predicted point of impact. Especially if you turn the ship perpendicular to the flight path now the target zone is only 252 feet wide and increases the likelihood the missile will over or under shoot the target. Artillery and missiles don\u2019t average their impacts in circles, but in ovals with the greatest deviation based on the gun to target line (gtl).\n\nAllllll that said, this is still probably a \u201csomeone fucked up and we\u2019re gonna try to play it off\u201d thing. I can\u2019t say I haven\u2019t seen and done the same thing before, just, not to this scale."
