Amazon also controls access to that chain and the information customers can get about the products. Amazon is responsible for creating the system through which recalled products are necessary. Why does Amazon allow the sale of so many recalled products that it's a burden? Amazon is free to institute whatever recall conditions it may required between it and the sellers they freely agreed to partner with.

                "> The commission in **July 2024** ruled that Amazon was distributing products that are defective or fail to meet federal safety standards. The CPSC also said Amazon was legally responsible for the recall of more than 400,000 products, including faulty carbon monoxide detectors, hairdryers without electrocution protection and **children's sleepwear that violates federal flammability standards.** \n\nI can only imagine what Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said when he stopped the Washington Post editorial board from endorsing Kamala Harris: *\"The Democrats are trying to stop us from burning America's children to death in their sleep; we can't let their bleeding-heart, pro-child agenda win!\"* \n\n> \"The commission may issue recall orders to the manufacturers, distributors and retailers of a product, but not to third-party logistics providers who store the product in their warehouses and transport it to customers,\" Amazon stated its suit, filed on March 14 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. \n\n*\"We're not a 'distributor,' we're just a warehouser/transporter.

It is absolutely intended to be red meat to people like Trump and Xitler. \n\nAt the same time, maybe Amazon should consider devoting a little more effort to vetting products before selling them. I mean, if something is, for example, a fire hazard... you'd think they wouldn't want to be storing that in their warehouses regardless of anything else. \n\nI'd draw the line at who fulfilled the order. If Amazon is fulfilling the order and the item ships out of one of their warehouses... fuck 'em, they're on the hook to help collect units affected by recalls. If the third party is shipping directly to the customer, just using Amazon's site as a way to reach customers, then Amazon doesn't need to be involved.",

                "Such a feeble legal argument, the lawyers should be fired.\n\n\"We just store this stuff in our warehouses and transport it to customers.\"\n\nOh yeah? when's the last time you could shop the various products being shipped out at USPS?  eh?  you can buy packaging, you cannot buy the products being shipped.  they don't sell items process payment.\n\nWhat a shitty way to try to say they are not a retailer.\n\nthey might have a chance in the edge case of someone having a \"purchase/pay with amazon.\" button on their website for payment since the customer is not shopping the amazon website they are using amazon as a payment processor and then the choice to ship logistically through them comes in.   but if I browse a selection of products on your website, make a selection and pay, YOU ARE THE RETAILER.   they're gonna get wrecked here.\n\nFurther fwiw they could be considered a distributor due to the network of warehouses, some amazon product suppliers dont ever hold the product themselves... the manufacturer ships directly to amazon and amazon then distributes it... that's TWO legs!!!",

                "#Alabama Woman Charged with Attempted Murder After Deputy Shot in Shocking Confrontation\n\nA routine call to investigate a theft in Elmore County, Alabama, took a dramatic and violent turn when a woman allegedly pulled a gun and shot a deputy, landing herself behind bars on attempted murder charges.\n\nThe suspect, 40-year-old Ebony Bracy from Wetumpka, had initially been speaking with officers when the situation escalated. According to Sheriff Bill Franklin, she was reportedly incoherent when deputies arrived at the scene on Dozier Road in the Redland community. As officers conducted their investigation, they discovered Bracy had outstanding warrants, though details of these were not immediately disclosed.\n\nWhen they attempted to take her into custody, she allegedly drew a firearm and opened fire, hitting one deputy in the forearm. The bullet travelled up to his bicep, wounding him. In the chaos that followed, another deputy fired back, striking Bracy in the upper torso. Though the extent of her injury was not fully detailed, the sheriff suggested she would likely need stitches. A second woman, who had been standing behind Bracy, was also caught in the crossfire, taking a bullet to the thigh.\n\nBracy is now being held at the Elmore County Jail with bail set at a staggering $2 million. The state has launched an investigation into the incident, though officials have yet to release further details.\n\nWhat started as a theft report ended with gunfire, injuries and serious charges, leaving the community rattled and authorities determined to piece together exactly what led to the shocking turn of events.",

                "It\u2019s worth noting that Butch and Suni weren\u2019t really stranded. The capsule that brought them back has been docked to the station for the last 6 months and prior to that they had other emergency escape options. The main thing keeping them up there was logistics, bringing them home earlier would either mean spending >100 million on a dedicated mission to bring them down or leaving the station uncrewed for *months.* It\u2019s also worth noting that while 9 months is a long ISS stay it\u2019s not especially long. The normal crew mission to the ISS lasts 6 months and there have been people who have stayed for over a year. Now that isn\u2019t to minimize the struggle of the astronauts, I\u2019m sure they are happy to be finally returning home today after so long away from their families but I just wanted to provide context to their return. The media has done an especially poor job of covering the Starlinner situation and that was even for Musk and Trump made this an extremely political issue.",
