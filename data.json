                ">AUSTIN, Texas - Mark Sanders, the CEO of Superior HealthPlan, was dismissed from his position following revelations that his company had hired private investigators to gather personal information on customers, journalists, and even lawmakers.\n\n>The dismissal came just days after\u00a0Sanders testified before the Texas House Committee on the Delivery of Government Efficiency, where he confirmed that private investigators had been hired to surveil individuals with the goal of uncovering sensitive details.\n\n>In a\u00a0statement to The Dallas Morning News, Centene Corporation, the parent company of Superior HealthPlan, expressed its disapproval of the actions taken by Sanders.\n\n>\u201cThe conduct highlighted during the Texas House Committee hearing is not reflective of our values, nor is it a practice Centene\u2019s current leadership condones,\u201d the statement read. \u201cTo this end, Mark Sanders is no longer with our organization.\u201d\n\n>Following Sanders\u2019 testimony, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton\u2019s office confirmed that an investigation into the matter had been launched.\n\n>The controversy erupted during a meeting of the House Committee on the Delivery of Government Efficiency, which was initially focused on the state\u2019s procurement process for managed care organizations like Superior HealthPlan. Committee Chair Giovanni Capriglione, a Republican from Southlake, was quick to confront Sanders about the company\u2019s use of taxpayer funds to hire private investigators.\n\n>\u201cI don\u2019t think what any of us expected was for a health insurance company, funded mostly by Texas taxpayer dollars, to use some of those funds to hire private investigators,\u201d Capriglione said. He pointed to one particular instance in which investigators were allegedly hired to follow a mother whose child had been denied medical care, exacerbating the child\u2019s condition.\n\n>When Capriglione asked Sanders directly if investigators had been employed to dig into the backgrounds of customers, government officials, and even a reporter, Sanders admitted to the practice. He explained that the goal was to learn more about the individuals with whom the company interacted, a justification that was met with scorn from Representative Matt Tinderholt.\n\n>\u201cYou wanted leverage, and you thought that you were going to use it,\u201d Tinderholt responded, adding, \u201cI dare you to investigate me. Do it, and bring it.\u201d\n\n>In a subsequent press release, Attorney General Paxton\u2019s office suggested that the actions might amount to potential blackmail intended to secure state contracts or avoid paying legitimate medical claims. The investigation, Paxton stated, would determine if any illegal activity had occurred.\n\nSaved you a click",
