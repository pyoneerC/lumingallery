                "LOL. Alcatraz closed because it was an insanely expensive way to do the exact same thing ADX Florence and others do at a fraction of the cost. With modern security technology there\u2019s literally no benefit to sticking prisoners on an island. Zero. And it\u2019s 10x more expensive. Shipping building materials, food, paying corrections officers in a top 10 most expensive city in the world, etc. Pure stupidity.",

It's a tourist attraction now-days and the size of the island will really limit how \"substantially\" they can \"enlarge\" the prison. \n\nThis will be a very expensive undertaking for what seems to me, limited payoff. Why not enlarge and improve existing facilities that are currently in use and not on an island? The obvious answer here is that Trump likes the reputation of Alcatraz and wants to use its name and branding to show he's tough on crime.

On the day she disappeared, she left home to pick up her pay cheque from the woollen mill where she worked.*\n\nI'm wondering what happened to her two children from that very early marriage. Anyway, the story makes lots of sense... she just hitch-hikes out of town with her baby-sitter... they split up and go their own ways...Backeberg out of state and lost almost forever.",
                "My grandmother effectively did this to her first two kids. her first husband was wealthy and influential. He was also abusive and controlling of her. He told her if she divorced him she would never see her children again. She left anyway and she wouldn't see her kids again until she was eighty years old after he died and her kids found out she was still alive (the husband told them she died). \n\nThe way she put it, the kids would have had a dead mother whether she stayed or not, so she chose to leave and live with the hope she would see them again one day instead of staying and either being killed by him or killing herself.\n\nEdit: I'm seeing a lot of comments under this arguing over different scenarios so I'll add more context to the story to help clear things up. \n\nMy grandmother married this man when she was sixteen and he was nearly thirty. She had her first son when she was seventeen and the second at eighteen. The oldest was three when she left.\n\nHer husband was a literal piller of the community type. Very wealthy, from a well-to-do family, very involved in local and state politics due to his business connections. Donated to the local police department to keep them on side, had a team of lawyers at his disposal, the works. \n\nMeanwhile my grandmother was from a poor family of nine growing up in a rural community. They had nothing and her marriage to this man (who she met after she participated in a beauty pageant, of which he was one of the producers,  and who asked to marry her mere months after said meeting) was seen as her and her family's way out of poverty. \n\nFrom how she described it to me, she knew she could not leave and keep her kids. Everyone she knew was local and she couldn't risk hiding out with them, it was the 50's and she had no job experience, she knew if she tried to kidnap her children she would be tracked down, labeled insane and put away somewhere where she would never see her kids again. She knew she would lose a legal battle for custody given her husband's connections, and she also knew the cops wouldn't help because one night she did call them and when she told them what was happening and her address, they hung up on her. He apparently beat her the next night because his buddies at the station told him she called. \n\nAccording to her, he never touched the kids, and she didn't think he ever would. What gave her that confidence, I don't know. \n\nHe granted her the divorce on the grounds she gave up custody, never contacted them again, never went public about what he did to her, and collaborated his story that he chose to divorce her due to her having a drinking problem and him not feeling safe with her around the kids. \n\nTo quote my grandmother as best as I can remember \n\n\"I thought about killing him and running away with them, stealing all the money I could from the house and starting over somewhere, but I knew I wouldn't get away with it, and my boys would end up living with his parents while I was thrown in jail. I had this mentality,  despite everything, that the boys deserved to have at least one of us around, so I agreed and left. My family knew the truth, but we never let it get out out of fear of him coming after us. I've had to make a lot of hard decisions in my life, but leaving my boys with him was the hardest thing I've ever done. I wish I could say I did it completely out of selflessness, that it was all for them, but there was always a part of me. A small, small part, that was just relieved I was free of him forever\". \n\nShe was so scared of him that when her sons contacted her  over sixty years later the first thing she asked was if their father was still alive. He had died a month prior to pancreatic cancer, they had spent the better part of a year looking for her after their step mother told them the truth. After learning everything from their father, who apparently became very truthful in his last days. they had no anger towards my grandmother for what she did. \n\nFor their father's part, he never abused them though he was very much a tough love parent with them while they were growing up which had already left them with a strained relationship prior to all this coming to light. They grew up very well off, both going to Ivy League schools. I know the one went into biomedical engineering I can't remember what the other did. \n\nThey would only meet my grandmother a few times before she herself passed away a year later due to a head injury from a fall. I only met them once and it was at the funeral. I haven't spoken to them since and neither has anybody else in the family as far as I know. Not due to hostility but simply due to us all having our own families and lives. \n\nI hope that helps clear any questions up.",
                "My father abandoned his wife of 6 years and 3 small children in 1964.  Literally went out for cigarettes and never came home.  The act completely wrecked the family: the kids were adopted out to other family members and the mom was never the same again.   \n\n2 years later in 1966 he met my mother, settled down under an assumed name, and had my sister in 1968 and me in 1973.  He took my birth certificate and created a new identity for himself (I never got a SS card until I was 12, and officially I am \"Junior\" even though my birth certificate says otherwise).  We found this out after his death in 2019, [when I found an envelope](https://imgur.com/t7LcmY3) addressed to me only, with 3 fake birth certificates, 3 sets of legit Social Security cards, 3 identities and a bunch of still-cryptic papers no one quite knows what to make of.  \n\nNo one knew.  We got in contact with our half siblings.  They are lovely people who have come to peace with the whole situation and are pretty well adjusted.  My sister and I are not and feel constant guilt over it.",

On the day she disappeared, she left home to pick up her pay cheque from the woollen mill where she worked.*\n\nI'm wondering what happened to her two children from that very early marriage. Anyway, the story makes lots of sense... she just hitch-hikes out of town with her baby-sitter... they split up and go their own ways...Backeberg out of state and lost almost forever.",
                "My grandmother effectively did this to her first two kids. her first husband was wealthy and influential. He was also abusive and controlling of her. He told her if she divorced him she would never see her children again. She left anyway and she wouldn't see her kids again until she was eighty years old after he died and her kids found out she was still alive (the husband told them she died). \n\nThe way she put it, the kids would have had a dead mother whether she stayed or not, so she chose to leave and live with the hope she would see them again one day instead of staying and either being killed by him or killing herself.\n\nEdit: I'm seeing a lot of comments under this arguing over different scenarios so I'll add more context to the story to help clear things up. \n\nMy grandmother married this man when she was sixteen and he was nearly thirty. She had her first son when she was seventeen and the second at eighteen. The oldest was three when she left.\n\nHer husband was a literal piller of the community type. Very wealthy, from a well-to-do family, very involved in local and state politics due to his business connections. Donated to the local police department to keep them on side, had a team of lawyers at his disposal, the works. \n\nMeanwhile my grandmother was from a poor family of nine growing up in a rural community. They had nothing and her marriage to this man (who she met after she participated in a beauty pageant, of which he was one of the producers,  and who asked to marry her mere months after said meeting) was seen as her and her family's way out of poverty. \n\nFrom how she described it to me, she knew she could not leave and keep her kids. Everyone she knew was local and she couldn't risk hiding out with them, it was the 50's and she had no job experience, she knew if she tried to kidnap her children she would be tracked down, labeled insane and put away somewhere where she would never see her kids again. She knew she would lose a legal battle for custody given her husband's connections, and she also knew the cops wouldn't help because one night she did call them and when she told them what was happening and her address, they hung up on her. He apparently beat her the next night because his buddies at the station told him she called. \n\nAccording to her, he never touched the kids, and she didn't think he ever would. What gave her that confidence, I don't know. \n\nHe granted her the divorce on the grounds she gave up custody, never contacted them again, never went public about what he did to her, and collaborated his story that he chose to divorce her due to her having a drinking problem and him not feeling safe with her around the kids. \n\nTo quote my grandmother as best as I can remember \n\n\"I thought about killing him and running away with them, stealing all the money I could from the house and starting over somewhere, but I knew I wouldn't get away with it, and my boys would end up living with his parents while I was thrown in jail. I had this mentality,  despite everything, that the boys deserved to have at least one of us around, so I agreed and left. My family knew the truth, but we never let it get out out of fear of him coming after us. I've had to make a lot of hard decisions in my life, but leaving my boys with him was the hardest thing I've ever done. I wish I could say I did it completely out of selflessness, that it was all for them, but there was always a part of me. A small, small part, that was just relieved I was free of him forever\". \n\nShe was so scared of him that when her sons contacted her  over sixty years later the first thing she asked was if their father was still alive. He had died a month prior to pancreatic cancer, they had spent the better part of a year looking for her after their step mother told them the truth. After learning everything from their father, who apparently became very truthful in his last days. they had no anger towards my grandmother for what she did. \n\nFor their father's part, he never abused them though he was very much a tough love parent with them while they were growing up which had already left them with a strained relationship prior to all this coming to light. They grew up very well off, both going to Ivy League schools. I know the one went into biomedical engineering I can't remember what the other did. \n\nThey would only meet my grandmother a few times before she herself passed away a year later due to a head injury from a fall. I only met them once and it was at the funeral. I haven't spoken to them since and neither has anybody else in the family as far as I know. Not due to hostility but simply due to us all having our own families and lives. \n\nI hope that helps clear any questions up.",
                "My father abandoned his wife of 6 years and 3 small children in 1964.  Literally went out for cigarettes and never came home.  The act completely wrecked the family: the kids were adopted out to other family members and the mom was never the same again.   \n\n2 years later in 1966 he met my mother, settled down under an assumed name, and had my sister in 1968 and me in 1973.  He took my birth certificate and created a new identity for himself (I never got a SS card until I was 12, and officially I am \"Junior\" even though my birth certificate says otherwise).  We found this out after his death in 2019, [when I found an envelope](https://imgur.com/t7LcmY3) addressed to me only, with 3 fake birth certificates, 3 sets of legit Social Security cards, 3 identities and a bunch of still-cryptic papers no one quite knows what to make of.  \n\nNo one knew.  We got in contact with our half siblings.  They are lovely people who have come to peace with the whole situation and are pretty well adjusted.  My sister and I are not and feel constant guilt over it.",

Anyway, the story makes lots of sense... she just hitch-hikes out of town with her baby-sitter... they split up and go their own ways...Backeberg out of state and lost almost forever.",
                "My grandmother effectively did this to her first two kids. her first husband was wealthy and influential. He was also abusive and controlling of her. He told her if she divorced him she would never see her children again. She left anyway and she wouldn't see her kids again until she was eighty years old after he died and her kids found out she was still alive (the husband told them she died). \n\nThe way she put it, the kids would have had a dead mother whether she stayed or not, so she chose to leave and live with the hope she would see them again one day instead of staying and either being killed by him or killing herself.\n\nEdit: I'm seeing a lot of comments under this arguing over different scenarios so I'll add more context to the story to help clear things up. \n\nMy grandmother married this man when she was sixteen and he was nearly thirty. She had her first son when she was seventeen and the second at eighteen. The oldest was three when she left.\n\nHer husband was a literal piller of the community type. Very wealthy, from a well-to-do family, very involved in local and state politics due to his business connections. Donated to the local police department to keep them on side, had a team of lawyers at his disposal, the works. \n\nMeanwhile my grandmother was from a poor family of nine growing up in a rural community. They had nothing and her marriage to this man (who she met after she participated in a beauty pageant, of which he was one of the producers,  and who asked to marry her mere months after said meeting) was seen as her and her family's way out of poverty. \n\nFrom how she described it to me, she knew she could not leave and keep her kids. Everyone she knew was local and she couldn't risk hiding out with them, it was the 50's and she had no job experience, she knew if she tried to kidnap her children she would be tracked down, labeled insane and put away somewhere where she would never see her kids again. She knew she would lose a legal battle for custody given her husband's connections, and she also knew the cops wouldn't help because one night she did call them and when she told them what was happening and her address, they hung up on her. He apparently beat her the next night because his buddies at the station told him she called. \n\nAccording to her, he never touched the kids, and she didn't think he ever would. What gave her that confidence, I don't know. \n\nHe granted her the divorce on the grounds she gave up custody, never contacted them again, never went public about what he did to her, and collaborated his story that he chose to divorce her due to her having a drinking problem and him not feeling safe with her around the kids. \n\nTo quote my grandmother as best as I can remember \n\n\"I thought about killing him and running away with them, stealing all the money I could from the house and starting over somewhere, but I knew I wouldn't get away with it, and my boys would end up living with his parents while I was thrown in jail. I had this mentality,  despite everything, that the boys deserved to have at least one of us around, so I agreed and left. My family knew the truth, but we never let it get out out of fear of him coming after us. I've had to make a lot of hard decisions in my life, but leaving my boys with him was the hardest thing I've ever done. I wish I could say I did it completely out of selflessness, that it was all for them, but there was always a part of me. A small, small part, that was just relieved I was free of him forever\". \n\nShe was so scared of him that when her sons contacted her  over sixty years later the first thing she asked was if their father was still alive. He had died a month prior to pancreatic cancer, they had spent the better part of a year looking for her after their step mother told them the truth. After learning everything from their father, who apparently became very truthful in his last days. they had no anger towards my grandmother for what she did. \n\nFor their father's part, he never abused them though he was very much a tough love parent with them while they were growing up which had already left them with a strained relationship prior to all this coming to light. They grew up very well off, both going to Ivy League schools. I know the one went into biomedical engineering I can't remember what the other did. \n\nThey would only meet my grandmother a few times before she herself passed away a year later due to a head injury from a fall. I only met them once and it was at the funeral. I haven't spoken to them since and neither has anybody else in the family as far as I know. Not due to hostility but simply due to us all having our own families and lives. \n\nI hope that helps clear any questions up.",
                "My father abandoned his wife of 6 years and 3 small children in 1964.  Literally went out for cigarettes and never came home.  The act completely wrecked the family: the kids were adopted out to other family members and the mom was never the same again.   \n\n2 years later in 1966 he met my mother, settled down under an assumed name, and had my sister in 1968 and me in 1973.  He took my birth certificate and created a new identity for himself (I never got a SS card until I was 12, and officially I am \"Junior\" even though my birth certificate says otherwise).  We found this out after his death in 2019, [when I found an envelope](https://imgur.com/t7LcmY3) addressed to me only, with 3 fake birth certificates, 3 sets of legit Social Security cards, 3 identities and a bunch of still-cryptic papers no one quite knows what to make of.  \n\nNo one knew.  We got in contact with our half siblings.  They are lovely people who have come to peace with the whole situation and are pretty well adjusted.  My sister and I are not and feel constant guilt over it.",
