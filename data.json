They said more information would be released as it becomes available.\n\nWitnesses on scene said about 45 police, fire and medical vehicles were on scene around 5:30 p.m. They saw city and state police enter the building with long rifles and K-9 units.\n\nPeople were being allowed to leave the mall in groups, a witness said.\n\nAn employee at Apple Cinemas Brass Mill said the shooting happened shortly before 4:40 p.m. They said they heard dozens of gunshots from the first floor of the mall in a matter of seconds, followed by screaming.\n\nFahd Syed's son was working inside the mall when the shooting occurred and he saw one of the injured victims on the floor screaming for help. Syed said his son couldn't help the woman \"because he didn't know if he was going to get shot himself.\"\n\nConnecticut State Police said troopers also responded to the incident, but directed any inquiries to the\u00a0Waterbury Police Department.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated as information becomes available.\n\nReporters Andreas Yilma and Bruno Matarazzo contributed to this story.",
