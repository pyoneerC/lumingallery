                "copy and paste in case of pay wall:\n\n Collier Landry heard a piercing scream and two thuds. He pulled the covers over his face as heavy footsteps passed outside his bedroom door. The glowing Batman clock on his wall said it was 3:17 a.m.\n\nThe 11-year-old boy held his breath, a flurry of questions racing through his mind: What was going on? Who was lurking outside his door? What had caused the commotion?\n\nThe footsteps briefly paused in the hallway \u2014 as if to check whether he was awake \u2014 then faded into the night.\n\nYoung Collier came downstairs the next morning looking for his mother. It was the last day of 1989 \u2014 New Year\u2019s Eve \u2014 and his father sat on the living room couch in their home in Mansfield, Ohio. He calmly told his son that his mother had left them and gone on a vacation.\n\nSensing Collier\u2019s distrust, his father told him, \u201cI never laid a finger on mommy.\u201d He threatened to punish him if he called the police and reported that she\u2019d disappeared, Landry later said.\n\nThe boy felt something was off. His mother wouldn\u2019t just leave him \u2014 especially not during the holiday season, he said. And so began a tragedy that captivated north-central Ohio and soon unearthed one dark secret after another.\n\nDetermined to uncover the truth, Collier called a friend of his mother\u2019s \u2014 a woman she\u2019d urged him to contact in an emergency. The call prompted a police investigation, with Collier as a key witness. Without his father\u2019s knowledge he provided crucial details to the lead detective, marking a turning point in the case.\n\nThree weeks after she vanished, police exhumed Noreen Boyle\u2019s body from the basement of a home 175 miles away in Erie, Pennsylvania. She was wrapped in a green tarp and her head was covered with a white plastic bag, which a coroner testified had been used to suffocate her.\n\nFive months later John Francis Boyle Jr. was found guilty of aggravated murder and sentenced to 20 years to life in prison.\n\nAfter more than three decades, the case is back in the spotlight with the release of a new podcast, \u201cFinding Mom\u2019s Killer,\u201d which chronicles how the preteen boy teamed up with Mansfield police detective Dave Messmore to uncover the devastating truth about his mother\u2019s disappearance. Collier Landry told CNN that after years of silence he now regularly talks to his father, who is incarcerated at the Marion Correctional Institute in Ohio.\n\nBoyle is now 81, and his third parole hearing is approaching in August. His son is struggling with a new whirlwind of emotions at the possibility of his dad\u2019s release from prison.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel vengeful toward my father \u2026 but it doesn\u2019t mean that we can skip down the yellow brick road holding hands and being like, you know, everything\u2019s great,\u201d said Landry, who dropped the Boyle name after his father\u2019s conviction.\n\nLandry is 47 now \u2014 about the same age as his father when he killed his mother.\n\n\u201cI wonder, am I like him? Am I capable of this?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat separates my life with this person\u2019s life? Why am I the one who will not carry on this legacy of violence?\u201d\nHe discovered his dad\u2019s secret while accompanying him on house calls\n\nTo an outsider, the Boyles\u2019 family life in the 1980s might have appeared idyllic.\n\nJohn Boyle was an osteopathic doctor who ran a family practice in Mansfield. His photogenic family looked like they\u2019d stepped from the pages of a magazine. The couple had also adopted a younger child, Elizabeth, from China and lived in a modest home with their wire fox terrier, Gowdy.\n\nLandry recalled some of his favorite moments during family road trips. His father played classical music in their car, and Landry would sit in the backseat, waving a straw and pretending to be the conductor.\n\nHe loved accompanying his father on his house calls \u2014 some doctors still made those back then \u2014 in the city of 50,000 people about 75 miles southwest of Cleveland.\n\nDuring those visits, his father appeared especially interested in a younger woman he described as one of his patients, Landry said. He witnessed his father and the woman taking walks, holding hands and stealing kisses. \n\n Landry became more suspicious when he noticed the woman was wearing his mom\u2019s diamond ring. It had two tiny bars to glide the diamonds back-and-forth, a distinctive design that made it easily noticeable, he said.\n\nHe told his mom about the other woman, which led to arguments between his parents, he said. His mother filed for divorce. She began to feel unsafe and gave him the names and numbers of her friends, he said.\n\n\u201cShe said, \u2018Collier, if your father happens to say that I might have left, call all my friends and have them contact the police and have them investigate how I disappeared,\u2019\u201d Landry testified in court.\n\nThe boy hid the paper with the phone numbers inside a stuffed Garfield cat on his bedroom dresser \u2014 not knowing that he\u2019d need it only weeks later.\nA meeting with a detective changed the course of the investigation\n\nLess than two months after the couple filed for divorce, Noreen Boyle disappeared.\n\nSuspicious, Collier called her friends soon after, and they notified the police. Messmore, the Mansfield Police detective, showed up at the Boyles\u2019 doorstep.\n\nMessmore, who\u2019s now retired, told CNN that it was unusual for police to rely on the word of an 11-year-old. But Collier \u2014 with his neatly coiffed brown hair, pressed slacks, polo shirt and penny loafers \u2014 seemed to the detective like a miniature adult who made it clear in no uncertain terms that something had happened to his mother.\n\n\u201cHe was \u2026 adamant that there was something really wrong,\u201d Messmore said. \u201cHe was close with his mother, and she took him everywhere.\u201d \n\n As Messmore looked deeper into Collier\u2019s concerns, he discovered the couple was in the middle of a bitter divorce and fighting over alimony, child support, joint credit card debts and other financial issues, he said.\n\nMessmore visited the boy at his elementary school. With permission from the principal, they would meet in an empty classroom and talk.\n\nAbout two weeks after Noreen Boyle\u2019s disappearance, Collier found photos in the console of his father\u2019s truck that changed the course of the investigation.\n\nThey showed his father hugging the younger woman next to a fireplace inside a house the boy had never seen before. The woman appeared pregnant. Collier shared the information with Messmore, who discovered that Boyle planned to shutter his Ohio practice for a lucrative job at a company in Erie.\n\nMessmore also learned that Boyle and the woman had bought the house in Erie together, and she had signed the real estate paperwork as his wife.\n\nA search of the Mansfield home had not yielded any clues, so investigators got a warrant for the Erie home, Messmore said.\n\nAuthorities spotted a green carpet in one section of the home\u2019s unfinished basement and ripped it out to reveal a fresh patch of concrete in the shape of a gravesite. They cracked it open and found her body.\n\nProsecutors learned Boyle had rented a jackhammer two days before his wife disappeared and cited it as evidence of premeditation.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t something where he just lost his temper. It was something he planned for a period of time,\u201d Messmore said.\n\nBoyle was indicted and went on trial in June 1990.\n\nCollier, who was the prosecution\u2019s star witness, described the sounds he heard that night. He also shared how his father\u2019s demeanor changed after his mother disappeared. The morning she went missing, he took both children to McDonald\u2019s for pancakes.\n\n\u201cHe was acting like daddy dearest and daddy perfect and so nice and stuff like that,\u201d he testified, according to a court transcript.\n\nA jury found Boyle guilty. In statements to the jury, the prosecution used chilling words to describe the doctor: \u201cHealer by day, killer by night.\u201d\nAfter years of silence, he recently reconnected with his father\n\nWithin months, Collier lost everything: his parents, his sister, his home, his dog. He went from a little boy whose parents doted on him to being the child of both a murderer and a victim.\n\nHe lived in foster homes \u2014 Messmore\u2019s family briefly took him in \u2014 before he was adopted by a Mansfield couple whose child attended the same private school. His adopted sister went to a different home and like him, changed her last name. Landry has not seen her since, he said.\n\nStill haunted by his mother\u2019s death, Collier Landry reached out to his father in prison not long after he was found guilty. In one of his initial letters in March 1991, he got straight to the point. \n\n \u201cDad, just to get things off my chest, why did you kill my mom? I know you think you didn\u2019t do it, but if you didn\u2019t, why are you in prison?\u201d he wrote. \u201cDon\u2019t get my reasoning wrong. I do love you. Even though you have hurt me \u2026 you are my father. And I owe you a great debt.\u201d\n\nHis father was appealing his conviction and responded with letters calling Landry a liar and urging him to recant his testimony. After he refused, his father sent him an eight-page letter in November 1992 suggesting he was delusional, Landry said.\n\n\u201cI will not subscribe to your petulant attitude. I will not feel sorry for poor Collier,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYour day is coming when all will be displayed in court. The difference will be that I will not remain silent this time. You have released me from any compulsion to protect you.\u201d",
                "Wow what a read.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nA family member of mine is married to a guy that went through something similar when he was a child. His mom snapped and shot and killed his dad. I've only ever met him a few times but every time I have, he's always been drunk. I can't imagine it's easy to carry the weight of that.",
                "The father sounds like a real piece of work. Deny the murder for decades. Tell the son he\u2019s a delusional liar. Then later admit to the murder but call it an accident. You don\u2019t accidentally kill someone and then rent a jackhammer and bury them in cement in the basement of your newly purchased home with your soon to be new girlfriend/wife.",
                "Thank you for writing up the story for us to read. I admire Landry strength. It is so difficult to live past such a traumatic event. He must have felt lost, betrayed, lonely. His father should die in prison.",
                "The way the murderer calls his dead wife \"it\" in his confession is chilling.\u00a0 The son is right, this man should not be released from prison.",
                "This is tragic. \nI\u2019m glad both kids got adopted and that Landry is finding his way and has made a decent life. \n\nI think this is a good piece to read to think more about challenging times with a live in partner. \n\nI think if one feels concerned enough for one\u2019s safety to give your kid info on who to contact, then maybe it is time to find a way to organize to leave that home with the kids. \n\nHe planned it, she was concerned that she could be disappeared. \n\nDomestic violence is not uncommon. It is very complex. It is good to think about what supports one has and being able to determine when it is time to get out of one can. \n\nPlease be safe y\u2019all",
                "It's a little strange to hear that Collier Landry is speaking to his father and is anywhere near being on the path to mending their relationship, because he's said before that his father is a narcissist. Narcissists don't change. Mending anything with them is a recipe for disaster.",
                "There was a Forensic Files episode on this case, and Collier has such bravery to be able to stand up to his father."

I won't judge him on his trauma response, because the whole thing was deeply traumatic.",
                "copy and paste in case of pay wall:\n\n Collier Landry heard a piercing scream and two thuds. He pulled the covers over his face as heavy footsteps passed outside his bedroom door. The glowing Batman clock on his wall said it was 3:17 a.m.\n\nThe 11-year-old boy held his breath, a flurry of questions racing through his mind: What was going on? Who was lurking outside his door? What had caused the commotion?\n\nThe footsteps briefly paused in the hallway \u2014 as if to check whether he was awake \u2014 then faded into the night.\n\nYoung Collier came downstairs the next morning looking for his mother. It was the last day of 1989 \u2014 New Year\u2019s Eve \u2014 and his father sat on the living room couch in their home in Mansfield, Ohio. He calmly told his son that his mother had left them and gone on a vacation.\n\nSensing Collier\u2019s distrust, his father told him, \u201cI never laid a finger on mommy.\u201d He threatened to punish him if he called the police and reported that she\u2019d disappeared, Landry later said.\n\nThe boy felt something was off. His mother wouldn\u2019t just leave him \u2014 especially not during the holiday season, he said. And so began a tragedy that captivated north-central Ohio and soon unearthed one dark secret after another.\n\nDetermined to uncover the truth, Collier called a friend of his mother\u2019s \u2014 a woman she\u2019d urged him to contact in an emergency. The call prompted a police investigation, with Collier as a key witness. Without his father\u2019s knowledge he provided crucial details to the lead detective, marking a turning point in the case.\n\nThree weeks after she vanished, police exhumed Noreen Boyle\u2019s body from the basement of a home 175 miles away in Erie, Pennsylvania. She was wrapped in a green tarp and her head was covered with a white plastic bag, which a coroner testified had been used to suffocate her.\n\nFive months later John Francis Boyle Jr. was found guilty of aggravated murder and sentenced to 20 years to life in prison.\n\nAfter more than three decades, the case is back in the spotlight with the release of a new podcast, \u201cFinding Mom\u2019s Killer,\u201d which chronicles how the preteen boy teamed up with Mansfield police detective Dave Messmore to uncover the devastating truth about his mother\u2019s disappearance. Collier Landry told CNN that after years of silence he now regularly talks to his father, who is incarcerated at the Marion Correctional Institute in Ohio.\n\nBoyle is now 81, and his third parole hearing is approaching in August. His son is struggling with a new whirlwind of emotions at the possibility of his dad\u2019s release from prison.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel vengeful toward my father \u2026 but it doesn\u2019t mean that we can skip down the yellow brick road holding hands and being like, you know, everything\u2019s great,\u201d said Landry, who dropped the Boyle name after his father\u2019s conviction.\n\nLandry is 47 now \u2014 about the same age as his father when he killed his mother.\n\n\u201cI wonder, am I like him? Am I capable of this?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat separates my life with this person\u2019s life? Why am I the one who will not carry on this legacy of violence?\u201d\nHe discovered his dad\u2019s secret while accompanying him on house calls\n\nTo an outsider, the Boyles\u2019 family life in the 1980s might have appeared idyllic.\n\nJohn Boyle was an osteopathic doctor who ran a family practice in Mansfield. His photogenic family looked like they\u2019d stepped from the pages of a magazine. The couple had also adopted a younger child, Elizabeth, from China and lived in a modest home with their wire fox terrier, Gowdy.\n\nLandry recalled some of his favorite moments during family road trips. His father played classical music in their car, and Landry would sit in the backseat, waving a straw and pretending to be the conductor.\n\nHe loved accompanying his father on his house calls \u2014 some doctors still made those back then \u2014 in the city of 50,000 people about 75 miles southwest of Cleveland.\n\nDuring those visits, his father appeared especially interested in a younger woman he described as one of his patients, Landry said. He witnessed his father and the woman taking walks, holding hands and stealing kisses. \n\n Landry became more suspicious when he noticed the woman was wearing his mom\u2019s diamond ring. It had two tiny bars to glide the diamonds back-and-forth, a distinctive design that made it easily noticeable, he said.\n\nHe told his mom about the other woman, which led to arguments between his parents, he said. His mother filed for divorce. She began to feel unsafe and gave him the names and numbers of her friends, he said.\n\n\u201cShe said, \u2018Collier, if your father happens to say that I might have left, call all my friends and have them contact the police and have them investigate how I disappeared,\u2019\u201d Landry testified in court.\n\nThe boy hid the paper with the phone numbers inside a stuffed Garfield cat on his bedroom dresser \u2014 not knowing that he\u2019d need it only weeks later.\nA meeting with a detective changed the course of the investigation\n\nLess than two months after the couple filed for divorce, Noreen Boyle disappeared.\n\nSuspicious, Collier called her friends soon after, and they notified the police. Messmore, the Mansfield Police detective, showed up at the Boyles\u2019 doorstep.\n\nMessmore, who\u2019s now retired, told CNN that it was unusual for police to rely on the word of an 11-year-old. But Collier \u2014 with his neatly coiffed brown hair, pressed slacks, polo shirt and penny loafers \u2014 seemed to the detective like a miniature adult who made it clear in no uncertain terms that something had happened to his mother.\n\n\u201cHe was \u2026 adamant that there was something really wrong,\u201d Messmore said. \u201cHe was close with his mother, and she took him everywhere.\u201d \n\n As Messmore looked deeper into Collier\u2019s concerns, he discovered the couple was in the middle of a bitter divorce and fighting over alimony, child support, joint credit card debts and other financial issues, he said.\n\nMessmore visited the boy at his elementary school. With permission from the principal, they would meet in an empty classroom and talk.\n\nAbout two weeks after Noreen Boyle\u2019s disappearance, Collier found photos in the console of his father\u2019s truck that changed the course of the investigation.\n\nThey showed his father hugging the younger woman next to a fireplace inside a house the boy had never seen before. The woman appeared pregnant. Collier shared the information with Messmore, who discovered that Boyle planned to shutter his Ohio practice for a lucrative job at a company in Erie.\n\nMessmore also learned that Boyle and the woman had bought the house in Erie together, and she had signed the real estate paperwork as his wife.\n\nA search of the Mansfield home had not yielded any clues, so investigators got a warrant for the Erie home, Messmore said.\n\nAuthorities spotted a green carpet in one section of the home\u2019s unfinished basement and ripped it out to reveal a fresh patch of concrete in the shape of a gravesite. They cracked it open and found her body.\n\nProsecutors learned Boyle had rented a jackhammer two days before his wife disappeared and cited it as evidence of premeditation.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t something where he just lost his temper. It was something he planned for a period of time,\u201d Messmore said.\n\nBoyle was indicted and went on trial in June 1990.\n\nCollier, who was the prosecution\u2019s star witness, described the sounds he heard that night. He also shared how his father\u2019s demeanor changed after his mother disappeared. The morning she went missing, he took both children to McDonald\u2019s for pancakes.\n\n\u201cHe was acting like daddy dearest and daddy perfect and so nice and stuff like that,\u201d he testified, according to a court transcript.\n\nA jury found Boyle guilty. In statements to the jury, the prosecution used chilling words to describe the doctor: \u201cHealer by day, killer by night.\u201d\nAfter years of silence, he recently reconnected with his father\n\nWithin months, Collier lost everything: his parents, his sister, his home, his dog. He went from a little boy whose parents doted on him to being the child of both a murderer and a victim.\n\nHe lived in foster homes \u2014 Messmore\u2019s family briefly took him in \u2014 before he was adopted by a Mansfield couple whose child attended the same private school. His adopted sister went to a different home and like him, changed her last name. Landry has not seen her since, he said.\n\nStill haunted by his mother\u2019s death, Collier Landry reached out to his father in prison not long after he was found guilty. In one of his initial letters in March 1991, he got straight to the point. \n\n \u201cDad, just to get things off my chest, why did you kill my mom? I know you think you didn\u2019t do it, but if you didn\u2019t, why are you in prison?\u201d he wrote. \u201cDon\u2019t get my reasoning wrong. I do love you. Even though you have hurt me \u2026 you are my father. And I owe you a great debt.\u201d\n\nHis father was appealing his conviction and responded with letters calling Landry a liar and urging him to recant his testimony. After he refused, his father sent him an eight-page letter in November 1992 suggesting he was delusional, Landry said.\n\n\u201cI will not subscribe to your petulant attitude. I will not feel sorry for poor Collier,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYour day is coming when all will be displayed in court. The difference will be that I will not remain silent this time. You have released me from any compulsion to protect you.\u201d",
                "Wow what a read.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nA family member of mine is married to a guy that went through something similar when he was a child. His mom snapped and shot and killed his dad. I've only ever met him a few times but every time I have, he's always been drunk. I can't imagine it's easy to carry the weight of that.",
                "The father sounds like a real piece of work. Deny the murder for decades. Tell the son he\u2019s a delusional liar. Then later admit to the murder but call it an accident. You don\u2019t accidentally kill someone and then rent a jackhammer and bury them in cement in the basement of your newly purchased home with your soon to be new girlfriend/wife.",
                "Thank you for writing up the story for us to read. I admire Landry strength. It is so difficult to live past such a traumatic event. He must have felt lost, betrayed, lonely. His father should die in prison.",
                "The way the murderer calls his dead wife \"it\" in his confession is chilling.\u00a0 The son is right, this man should not be released from prison.",
                "This is tragic. \nI\u2019m glad both kids got adopted and that Landry is finding his way and has made a decent life. \n\nI think this is a good piece to read to think more about challenging times with a live in partner. \n\nI think if one feels concerned enough for one\u2019s safety to give your kid info on who to contact, then maybe it is time to find a way to organize to leave that home with the kids. \n\nHe planned it, she was concerned that she could be disappeared. \n\nDomestic violence is not uncommon. It is very complex. It is good to think about what supports one has and being able to determine when it is time to get out of one can. \n\nPlease be safe y\u2019all",
                "It's a little strange to hear that Collier Landry is speaking to his father and is anywhere near being on the path to mending their relationship, because he's said before that his father is a narcissist. Narcissists don't change. Mending anything with them is a recipe for disaster.",
                "There was a Forensic Files episode on this case, and Collier has such bravery to be able to stand up to his father."

                "What an amazing story.  Thank you for the copy.\n\nThat must have been terrifying, having to live with the person you _know_ murdered his own wife, hoping he wouldn't know you were meeting with police, hoping he wouldn't do the same to you.",
                "Sad that he and his sister were broken up/not put in the same family, and that he never saw her again. \n\nI mean I would want to reach out to her as adult, if I were him. At least say, 'if you want to connect, I'd be fine with that in whatever capacity you choose.' But that's just me. I won't judge him on his trauma response, because the whole thing was deeply traumatic.",
                "copy and paste in case of pay wall:\n\n Collier Landry heard a piercing scream and two thuds. He pulled the covers over his face as heavy footsteps passed outside his bedroom door. The glowing Batman clock on his wall said it was 3:17 a.m.\n\nThe 11-year-old boy held his breath, a flurry of questions racing through his mind: What was going on? Who was lurking outside his door? What had caused the commotion?\n\nThe footsteps briefly paused in the hallway \u2014 as if to check whether he was awake \u2014 then faded into the night.\n\nYoung Collier came downstairs the next morning looking for his mother. It was the last day of 1989 \u2014 New Year\u2019s Eve \u2014 and his father sat on the living room couch in their home in Mansfield, Ohio. He calmly told his son that his mother had left them and gone on a vacation.\n\nSensing Collier\u2019s distrust, his father told him, \u201cI never laid a finger on mommy.\u201d He threatened to punish him if he called the police and reported that she\u2019d disappeared, Landry later said.\n\nThe boy felt something was off. His mother wouldn\u2019t just leave him \u2014 especially not during the holiday season, he said. And so began a tragedy that captivated north-central Ohio and soon unearthed one dark secret after another.\n\nDetermined to uncover the truth, Collier called a friend of his mother\u2019s \u2014 a woman she\u2019d urged him to contact in an emergency. The call prompted a police investigation, with Collier as a key witness. Without his father\u2019s knowledge he provided crucial details to the lead detective, marking a turning point in the case.\n\nThree weeks after she vanished, police exhumed Noreen Boyle\u2019s body from the basement of a home 175 miles away in Erie, Pennsylvania. She was wrapped in a green tarp and her head was covered with a white plastic bag, which a coroner testified had been used to suffocate her.\n\nFive months later John Francis Boyle Jr. was found guilty of aggravated murder and sentenced to 20 years to life in prison.\n\nAfter more than three decades, the case is back in the spotlight with the release of a new podcast, \u201cFinding Mom\u2019s Killer,\u201d which chronicles how the preteen boy teamed up with Mansfield police detective Dave Messmore to uncover the devastating truth about his mother\u2019s disappearance. Collier Landry told CNN that after years of silence he now regularly talks to his father, who is incarcerated at the Marion Correctional Institute in Ohio.\n\nBoyle is now 81, and his third parole hearing is approaching in August. His son is struggling with a new whirlwind of emotions at the possibility of his dad\u2019s release from prison.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel vengeful toward my father \u2026 but it doesn\u2019t mean that we can skip down the yellow brick road holding hands and being like, you know, everything\u2019s great,\u201d said Landry, who dropped the Boyle name after his father\u2019s conviction.\n\nLandry is 47 now \u2014 about the same age as his father when he killed his mother.\n\n\u201cI wonder, am I like him? Am I capable of this?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat separates my life with this person\u2019s life? Why am I the one who will not carry on this legacy of violence?\u201d\nHe discovered his dad\u2019s secret while accompanying him on house calls\n\nTo an outsider, the Boyles\u2019 family life in the 1980s might have appeared idyllic.\n\nJohn Boyle was an osteopathic doctor who ran a family practice in Mansfield. His photogenic family looked like they\u2019d stepped from the pages of a magazine. The couple had also adopted a younger child, Elizabeth, from China and lived in a modest home with their wire fox terrier, Gowdy.\n\nLandry recalled some of his favorite moments during family road trips. His father played classical music in their car, and Landry would sit in the backseat, waving a straw and pretending to be the conductor.\n\nHe loved accompanying his father on his house calls \u2014 some doctors still made those back then \u2014 in the city of 50,000 people about 75 miles southwest of Cleveland.\n\nDuring those visits, his father appeared especially interested in a younger woman he described as one of his patients, Landry said. He witnessed his father and the woman taking walks, holding hands and stealing kisses. \n\n Landry became more suspicious when he noticed the woman was wearing his mom\u2019s diamond ring. It had two tiny bars to glide the diamonds back-and-forth, a distinctive design that made it easily noticeable, he said.\n\nHe told his mom about the other woman, which led to arguments between his parents, he said. His mother filed for divorce. She began to feel unsafe and gave him the names and numbers of her friends, he said.\n\n\u201cShe said, \u2018Collier, if your father happens to say that I might have left, call all my friends and have them contact the police and have them investigate how I disappeared,\u2019\u201d Landry testified in court.\n\nThe boy hid the paper with the phone numbers inside a stuffed Garfield cat on his bedroom dresser \u2014 not knowing that he\u2019d need it only weeks later.\nA meeting with a detective changed the course of the investigation\n\nLess than two months after the couple filed for divorce, Noreen Boyle disappeared.\n\nSuspicious, Collier called her friends soon after, and they notified the police. Messmore, the Mansfield Police detective, showed up at the Boyles\u2019 doorstep.\n\nMessmore, who\u2019s now retired, told CNN that it was unusual for police to rely on the word of an 11-year-old. But Collier \u2014 with his neatly coiffed brown hair, pressed slacks, polo shirt and penny loafers \u2014 seemed to the detective like a miniature adult who made it clear in no uncertain terms that something had happened to his mother.\n\n\u201cHe was \u2026 adamant that there was something really wrong,\u201d Messmore said. \u201cHe was close with his mother, and she took him everywhere.\u201d \n\n As Messmore looked deeper into Collier\u2019s concerns, he discovered the couple was in the middle of a bitter divorce and fighting over alimony, child support, joint credit card debts and other financial issues, he said.\n\nMessmore visited the boy at his elementary school. With permission from the principal, they would meet in an empty classroom and talk.\n\nAbout two weeks after Noreen Boyle\u2019s disappearance, Collier found photos in the console of his father\u2019s truck that changed the course of the investigation.\n\nThey showed his father hugging the younger woman next to a fireplace inside a house the boy had never seen before. The woman appeared pregnant. Collier shared the information with Messmore, who discovered that Boyle planned to shutter his Ohio practice for a lucrative job at a company in Erie.\n\nMessmore also learned that Boyle and the woman had bought the house in Erie together, and she had signed the real estate paperwork as his wife.\n\nA search of the Mansfield home had not yielded any clues, so investigators got a warrant for the Erie home, Messmore said.\n\nAuthorities spotted a green carpet in one section of the home\u2019s unfinished basement and ripped it out to reveal a fresh patch of concrete in the shape of a gravesite. They cracked it open and found her body.\n\nProsecutors learned Boyle had rented a jackhammer two days before his wife disappeared and cited it as evidence of premeditation.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t something where he just lost his temper. It was something he planned for a period of time,\u201d Messmore said.\n\nBoyle was indicted and went on trial in June 1990.\n\nCollier, who was the prosecution\u2019s star witness, described the sounds he heard that night. He also shared how his father\u2019s demeanor changed after his mother disappeared. The morning she went missing, he took both children to McDonald\u2019s for pancakes.\n\n\u201cHe was acting like daddy dearest and daddy perfect and so nice and stuff like that,\u201d he testified, according to a court transcript.\n\nA jury found Boyle guilty. In statements to the jury, the prosecution used chilling words to describe the doctor: \u201cHealer by day, killer by night.\u201d\nAfter years of silence, he recently reconnected with his father\n\nWithin months, Collier lost everything: his parents, his sister, his home, his dog. He went from a little boy whose parents doted on him to being the child of both a murderer and a victim.\n\nHe lived in foster homes \u2014 Messmore\u2019s family briefly took him in \u2014 before he was adopted by a Mansfield couple whose child attended the same private school. His adopted sister went to a different home and like him, changed her last name. Landry has not seen her since, he said.\n\nStill haunted by his mother\u2019s death, Collier Landry reached out to his father in prison not long after he was found guilty. In one of his initial letters in March 1991, he got straight to the point. \n\n \u201cDad, just to get things off my chest, why did you kill my mom? I know you think you didn\u2019t do it, but if you didn\u2019t, why are you in prison?\u201d he wrote. \u201cDon\u2019t get my reasoning wrong. I do love you. Even though you have hurt me \u2026 you are my father. And I owe you a great debt.\u201d\n\nHis father was appealing his conviction and responded with letters calling Landry a liar and urging him to recant his testimony. After he refused, his father sent him an eight-page letter in November 1992 suggesting he was delusional, Landry said.\n\n\u201cI will not subscribe to your petulant attitude. I will not feel sorry for poor Collier,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYour day is coming when all will be displayed in court. The difference will be that I will not remain silent this time. You have released me from any compulsion to protect you.\u201d",
                "Wow what a read.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nA family member of mine is married to a guy that went through something similar when he was a child. His mom snapped and shot and killed his dad. I've only ever met him a few times but every time I have, he's always been drunk. I can't imagine it's easy to carry the weight of that.",
                "The father sounds like a real piece of work. Deny the murder for decades. Tell the son he\u2019s a delusional liar. Then later admit to the murder but call it an accident. You don\u2019t accidentally kill someone and then rent a jackhammer and bury them in cement in the basement of your newly purchased home with your soon to be new girlfriend/wife.",
                "Thank you for writing up the story for us to read. I admire Landry strength. It is so difficult to live past such a traumatic event. He must have felt lost, betrayed, lonely. His father should die in prison.",
                "The way the murderer calls his dead wife \"it\" in his confession is chilling.\u00a0 The son is right, this man should not be released from prison.",
                "This is tragic. \nI\u2019m glad both kids got adopted and that Landry is finding his way and has made a decent life. \n\nI think this is a good piece to read to think more about challenging times with a live in partner. \n\nI think if one feels concerned enough for one\u2019s safety to give your kid info on who to contact, then maybe it is time to find a way to organize to leave that home with the kids. \n\nHe planned it, she was concerned that she could be disappeared. \n\nDomestic violence is not uncommon. It is very complex. It is good to think about what supports one has and being able to determine when it is time to get out of one can. \n\nPlease be safe y\u2019all",
                "It's a little strange to hear that Collier Landry is speaking to his father and is anywhere near being on the path to mending their relationship, because he's said before that his father is a narcissist. Narcissists don't change. Mending anything with them is a recipe for disaster.",
                "There was a Forensic Files episode on this case, and Collier has such bravery to be able to stand up to his father."
