He had fallen off a chair and cut his chin open. He was very resistant to getting stitches and was wiggling his way out every time the ER doc attempted it. Eventually she threw her hands up saying they would do general anesthesia. She was told no way it was needlessly risky to do it, so we gave it one last go and he let her put the stitches in. Until then I don\u2019t think I had ever considered a risk in doing general anesthesia."

He had fallen off a chair and cut his chin open. He was very resistant to getting stitches and was wiggling his way out every time the ER doc attempted it. Eventually she threw her hands up saying they would do general anesthesia. She was told no way it was needlessly risky to do it, so we gave it one last go and he let her put the stitches in.

He had fallen off a chair and cut his chin open. He was very resistant to getting stitches and was wiggling his way out every time the ER doc attempted it. Eventually she threw her hands up saying they would do general anesthesia. She was told no way it was needlessly risky to do it, so we gave it one last go and he let her put the stitches in.
