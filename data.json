She's braindead because of that. They aren't just keeping her on life support to incubate the fetus, they KILLED HER in order to incubate the fetus.",

Her mother is going to live with this trauma for the rest of her life. \n\nAnd they\u2019re going to get the bill for all of this when they\u2019re finally allowed to let her pass.\n\nThe cruelty is the point, but it\u2019s amazing how often they keep coming up with new ways of being even crueler.",

                "The US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, said on Wednesday that he had directed the FDA to review the regulations around the abortion pill mifepristone.\n\nThe review, he said, was necessary due to \u201cnew data\u201d \u2013 data that emerged from a flawed analysis that top US anti-abortion groups are now using to pressure the Trump administration to reimpose restrictions on the abortion pill, if not pull it from the market entirely.\n\n...**The analysis, which has not been peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal**, came after the Food and Drug Administration commissioner said he was open to reviewing new safety data on the pills, which are used in nearly two-thirds of abortions nationwide.\n\nThe conservative organizations are rallying behind a paper published on 28 April by a rightwing thinktank, the Ethics and Public Policy Center, which claims there are higher complication rates from taking mifepristone than previously known.\n\nThe paper has attracted scrutiny for appearing to dramatically overstate what it characterizes as \u201cserious adverse effects\u201d associated with the pill, according to medical experts. For example, it counts ectopic pregnancies \u2013 when an embryo implants somewhere other than the uterine lining \u2013 as a serious complication.\n\nMifepristone does not cause an ectopic pregnancy and taking it will not harm someone with an ectopic. It also claims that needing an in-clinic procedure to complete the abortion is a complication, when patients are counseled in advance about the pills\u2019 failure rate of about 3 to 4%.\n\n**The data, the authors say, means the FDA should reinstate earlier restrictions on mifepristone, including a ban on telemedicine and limiting use to the first seven weeks of pregnancy \u2013 but they do not intend to stop there.**\n\nThe authors note that restoring the limits could lead to better monitoring that could help \u201cdetermine whether this drug should remain on the market\u201d, statements that echo proposals found in Project 2025, the 900-page playbook published by the Heritage Foundation and for which the EPPC was an advisory board member.\n\n**Project 2025 calls to end telemedicine prescriptions of abortion pills as an \u201cinterim step\u201d to revoking mifepristone\u2019s approval altogether.**\n\nMore than 100 scientific studies have found the medications cited in the paper are safe and effective for ending a pregnancy.",

                "Weird that anyone doesn't believe that they are really just trying to legislate that women are basically children that need men to make their decisions, so if you think about it that's why it is OK for them to marry children.\n\nLiterally, that is a pretty clear overlap on the venn diagram of legislating agenda they have been on target for.\n\n  \n\\----\n\nA quick edit so I don't come accross as hyperbolic or simply lobbing petty insults:  \n\nI realized I should probably [bring reciepts](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/republican-lawmakers-child-marriage-abortion-1235018777/). \n\nThere are a [*lot*](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/end-child-marriage-u-s-you-might-be-surprised-who-n1050471) of reciepts. \n\nThey've tried \"[defending child marriage is actually pretty pro-choice of me](https://www.newsweek.com/republican-defends-child-marriage-im-pro-choice-1898619)\" and \"[if you ban child marriage, you're letting the gays win](https://www.tba.org/?pg=Articles&blAction=showEntry&blogEntry=30366)\"  along the way . . . landing on their most successful attack yet . . .  \n\n\"[a woman is like a child](https://www.yahoo.com/news/woman-child-maga-quickly-turns-105907677.html)\" . . . and if woman == child, then it stands to reason that child == women . . . \n\nObviously, you wouldn't say women shouldn't be allowed to have an adult sexual relationship within the confines of a legally binding marriage contract that they can leave anytime they want to have enough money and a good lawyer. Which is also why child labor is so important, so that they could obviously have left the marriage if they didn't want to be there.\n\nIt also makes sense of other agenda pushes that would otherwise feel pointless and unrelated, like the absolute insane amounts of hate against women they've pushed on the youth in recent years."

It's a state university who is seeing a demographic that they don't think will latent their college alongside a trend they think is going to rock PA and shrinking itself now so it doesn't embarrass itself later. I don't know the state of PA so I don't know how this affects those closing campuses but I do feel that it's better to close than to occupy at limited capacity just to state that you're still open.

Obviously this will have an immediate direct effect on birthright citizenship if the courts overturn it, but then the executive order itself would have to be brought before the SCOTUS.",
