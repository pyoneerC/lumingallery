A simple majority is enough to impeach most officials, but a 2/3 majority is required to impeach the president. It was (and maybe still is) an open question what the requirement was to impeach an acting president - 151 because he is the prime minister, or 200 because he is (acting) president? Apparently some of the justices think it\u2019s the latter, (edit) but it seems like the majority ruled that it\u2019s 151.\n\nThis feels like it was the weakest of the cases, for what it\u2019s worth. He was consistently saying he was against the martial law, and it seems like they failed to prove he was actually involved with it.",
