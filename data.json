                "Summary:\n\nThe US State Department allegedly deleted evidence collected by Yale University\u2019s Humanitarian Research Lab, which was tracking Russian war crimes, including the abduction of 35,000 Ukrainian children. The deletion has hindered efforts to rescue the children and prosecute those responsible, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Yale project, funded by the US government until last month, monitored 116 sites in Russia using satellite imagery and other surveillance tools.\n\nSources suggest the deletion may have been accidental or intentional, raising potential legal risks for the Trump administration under international war crimes laws. The lost data was also being shared with the EU for its own investigations. The destruction of evidence not only affects legal cases but also complicates ongoing rescue missions.\n\nThe Yale project played a key role in gathering evidence that contributed to six ICC indictments, including against Putin and his commissioner for children\u2019s rights. Russia has been accused of forcibly transferring Ukrainian children, issuing Russian passports in occupied areas, and erasing Ukrainian identity. The loss of the secure \u201cCaesar\u201d database has been described as a violation of the Geneva Convention, which prohibits destroying war crimes evidence. The US State Department has yet to respond.",

The deletion has hindered efforts to rescue the children and prosecute those responsible, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Yale project, funded by the US government until last month, monitored 116 sites in Russia using satellite imagery and other surveillance tools.\n\nSources suggest the deletion may have been accidental or intentional, raising potential legal risks for the Trump administration under international war crimes laws. The lost data was also being shared with the EU for its own investigations. The destruction of evidence not only affects legal cases but also complicates ongoing rescue missions.\n\nThe Yale project played a key role in gathering evidence that contributed to six ICC indictments, including against Putin and his commissioner for children\u2019s rights. Russia has been accused of forcibly transferring Ukrainian children, issuing Russian passports in occupied areas, and erasing Ukrainian identity. The loss of the secure \u201cCaesar\u201d database has been described as a violation of the Geneva Convention, which prohibits destroying war crimes evidence.

Google would likely prevail on the merits of the case, because they definitely don't discriminate pay based on race.\n\n*Especially* in the past decade, when they've gotten extremely rigid and formulaic about standardizing pay. Google has extremely tight pay bands and its comp structure targets is extremely formulaic, depending almost entirely location (targetting something like the 90th percentile of total comp amongst peer companies in a given location => SF Bay Area / NYC have a higher premium than say, somewhere in the midwest US) and level. Crucially, those formulas don't include anything about race.\n\nThe targets are so formulaic and standardized such that when you reach the cap for your level / location, you won't get any more yearly merit increases even if you performance would otherwise merit it. The only thing you can do once you cap out is hope the target for your pay band moves up, e.g., due to that \"90th percentile among peers in your local market\" metric going up b/c of inflation or pay competition among local employers.\n\nWhat is true and what's likley happening, since the suit is about \"starting pay\" is probably a few counfounding variables. While your band is fixed by level and locatiohn, your starting place in your band can vary depending on your negotiations\u2014did you have competing offers, how strong were they, what was your hiring committee rating (hire / strong hire), did you even attempt to negotiate, etc.?\n\nSo I could see variability in *starting pay* due to confounding variables like working in lower cost of living areas, not negotiating as strongly, not having as many or high competing offers, lower hire rating, etc. But that's all about negotiations and interview performance.
