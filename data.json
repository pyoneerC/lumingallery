We paddled past him roughly 150 ft up the trail as he got out onto a slide, and he luckily must have eaten recently because he paid us no mind despite us being a few mere feet away from him. But in the back of my head for the whole trip all I could think of is how easily he vanished and how there could be anything below us at any given moment. At his size he very easily could have capsized our canoe if he really wanted to. Extremely unfortunate for this couple.",
