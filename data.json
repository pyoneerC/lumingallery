And she allegedly helped direct a series of threats that rattled Vernon-area schools for three months in late 2023 and early last year.\n\nThis is so disturbing.

And she allegedly helped direct a series of threats that rattled Vernon-area schools for three months in late 2023 and early last year.\n\nThis is so disturbing.
