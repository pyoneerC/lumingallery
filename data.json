                "This is a massive and direct disrespect to the people these MPs represent and the democratic system that represents all of us. Israel often hides behind its supposed democratic system, but that democracy only exists when you support their broad national agenda (especially the ongoing genocide in Palestine and their ongoing theft of territory).\n\nThey deny journalists access to hide their crimes (https://rsf.org/en/one-year-gaza-how-israel-orchestrated-media-blackout-region-war), murder them when they are witness (including British journalists: https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/apr/05/pressandpublishing.broadcasting) , murder aid workers (including British aid workers: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj68kkeyyz1o) and have killed between 50,000-70,000 people in Palestine (a third of which are estimated to be children). \n\nYet the UK keeps supporting them. We've been providing them aid, selling them weapons (https://www.oxfam.org.uk/get-involved/campaign-with-oxfam/gaza-israel-crisis-sign-petition-call-for-ceasefire-now/does-the-uk-sell-arms-to-israel/)  and spent billions flying constant reconissance flights to provide the Israeli army with intel (which we then refuse to review when it could prove Israel's crimes against British aid workers: https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/uk-wont-release-spy-plane-footage-related-killing-uk-aid-worker-gaza).\n\nThis isn't a disconnected conflict in a distant country we have nothing to do with- we are currently active partners in this genocide  Our RAF planes, and our tax money is being used to facilitate this slaughter while the government cuts services at home. And when our MPs want to visit, to assess the situation on our behalf as our representatives, Israel doesn't even let them in. It is long past time for the UK to act on our own values and self interests, stop spending money on Israel's bloody genocide and halt all arms sales to this psychotic regime.",
                "At what point do western countries start to sever ties with Israel? I mean this country treats us terribly, but still demands our money and support? Biggest welfare state in the world.\n\nEdit: below you will see an islamaphobic comment from someone who blocked me. The are trying to suggest that if you don't support Israel, you do support Islamic extremism. Israel survives because it's framed this issue as a dichotomy. The truth is, you could just not pay Israel or support any of it. It's a perfectly acceptable position that you could keep your money for yourself.",

Did they carry the formal documentation required? If so this is a diplomatic incident. If not then it's not a diplomatic delegation. Just being an MP arriving on an EasyJet flight is not a diplomatic visit.\n\nIt's all very confusing.",
