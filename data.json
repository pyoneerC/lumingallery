                ">A judge sentenced a man who blamed exposure to far-right extremist content for motivating his online threats to kill Democratic election officials in Colorado and Arizona to three years in prison Thursday, saying the penalty for such \u201ckeyboard terrorism\u201d needed to be serious enough to deter others from doing the same.\n\n>U.S. District Judge S. Kato Crews said that threats against election and other government officials are on the rise and people need to remember that differences need to be worked out through the democratic process, not violence.\n\n>\u201cThe public must not accept this as the norm,\u201d he said in handing down the sentence for Teak Ty Brockbank.\n\n>Brockbank pleaded guilty in October to making threats between September 2021 and August 2022 against Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold and former Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, who is now governor. He also threatened a Colorado judge and federal agents.\n\n>Brockbank apologized in court for his \u201cugly posts\u201d and said he has turned away from the fear, hate and anger that he found online that derailed his life.\n\n>Federal prosecutors sought three years in prison for Brockbank. He asked for leniency, saying he made the posts when he was drinking heavily, socially isolated and spending his evenings consuming conspiracy theories online. Jonathan Jacobson, a Washington-based trial attorney for the Justice Department\u2019s public integrity section, pointed out that the threats continued during a period when Brockbank wasn\u2019t drinking.\n\n>Brockbank posted online that Colorado\u2019s top election official should \u201cHang by the neck\u201d and her former counterpart in Arizona should also be put to death.\n\nKeyboard warrior or not, the nutcase deserves what he got, and then some.",

Representatives from Leipzig contacted the city in 2023 about their existence in Germany, where the university houses a skull collection dating to the 1800s. The school is in the process of repatriating or sending back skulls to their original locations. That initial call set in motion the creation of the Cultural Repatriation Committee, led by Baham.\n\n>\u201cWe are not talking about them as if they are skeletal remains,\u201d Baham said at the news conference. \u201cWe want to honor them by calling them the individuals that they are.\u201d\n\n>Dillard, one of two historically Black universities in New Orleans, along with Xavier University of Louisiana, welcomed the opportunity to be part of \u201cthis very sensitive acknowledgment of our people, that they are here,\u201d Guillory told NBC News. A visitation will take place Saturday at Dillard\u2019s Lawless Memorial Chapel with a service.\n\n>Laid to rest will be the remains of **Adam Grant, Isaak Bell, Hiram Smith, William Pierson, Henry Williams, John Brown, Hiram Malone, William Roberts, Alice Brown, Prescilla Hatchet, Marie Louise, Mahala, Samuel Prince, John Tolman, Henry Allen, Moses Willis and Henry Anderson.**\n\n>The two other people could not be identified.\n\nIt's all kinds of messed up that these people were cut up and their heads sent to Germany for eugenic cranial research, and just left there. And of course it was all done without permission.\n\nIt's 150 years after the fact, but at least they've finally been laid to rest and given some dignity back.",
