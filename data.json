When asked by the media to clarify, the source acts as if it was just a mistake. \n\nBlack Americans of the past went through the same playbook. You're told to leave or that \"you don't belong here\". Why? Someone wants their land, or their prosperity, or something petty. When confronted? \"It was just a mistake :(\"\n\nThis is why it's important to learn history and to pay attention to history as it's truly being repeated right now. Don't believe me?
