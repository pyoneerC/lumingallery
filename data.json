My parents lawyered up, Bailed me out 3 days or so later. It ended when her story kept changing and I had no wounds on my hands or face the night I was booked.  Can go much deeper in to the story but I won\u2019t bore y\u2019all. It was scary. She knew my address, phone number (land line back then) my vehicle, my overall everything. I was at my GF\u2019s house after school, did some day boozing, walked 2 blocks home, and went to bed. Then I was \u201cwoken up\u201d about 4 hours later. Lots of people I\u2019ve told the story too have said \u201cI\u2019ve had handled it this way\u201d. But I was woken up from a dead sleep, completely confused, 3 cops screaming at me, my dad freaking out, my mom in hysterics. \n\nThere were no consequences for the accuser. I moved across country for school and that was it. That was around \u201889 or \u201890. Fucking sucked.",

She eventually came clean, but the damage was done - the dude had mugshots, and was arrested in the middle of a crowded bar.  she didn't get so much as a slap on the wrist.  From what I understand, the guy was just so happy to have the charges dropped against him.  But he should have pressed charges against her for the damage she did to him.  \n\nThis was about 20 years ago that this happened.  and I still worry about how I was just a few months away from being 'the guy' in this story.",

Slavery \"officially\" ended in America in 1865, but it continued for decades thanks to loopholes in the form of predatory contracts. African Americans who had been kept illiterate by slavery were tricked into signing contracts with their former masters in which they were sold land in exchange for a percentage of their crops. The contracts were routinely altered, however, to make it impossible to actually pay off that land, creating a cycle of permanent debt slavery. It wasn't until reformers from the North started opening Black schools, and the people became educated, that African Americans were able to read and understand the contracts they were signing, seek legal counsel, find representation in Washington, etc. In other words, slavery doesn't end with an amendment. It ends with education.",

Slavery \"officially\" ended in America in 1865, but it continued for decades thanks to loopholes in the form of predatory contracts. African Americans who had been kept illiterate by slavery were tricked into signing contracts with their former masters in which they were sold land in exchange for a percentage of their crops. The contracts were routinely altered, however, to make it impossible to actually pay off that land, creating a cycle of permanent debt slavery. It wasn't until reformers from the North started opening Black schools, and the people became educated, that African Americans were able to read and understand the contracts they were signing, seek legal counsel, find representation in Washington, etc. In other words, slavery doesn't end with an amendment.

Slavery \"officially\" ended in America in 1865, but it continued for decades thanks to loopholes in the form of predatory contracts. African Americans who had been kept illiterate by slavery were tricked into signing contracts with their former masters in which they were sold land in exchange for a percentage of their crops. The contracts were routinely altered, however, to make it impossible to actually pay off that land, creating a cycle of permanent debt slavery. It wasn't until reformers from the North started opening Black schools, and the people became educated, that African Americans were able to read and understand the contracts they were signing, seek legal counsel, find representation in Washington, etc. In other words, slavery doesn't end with an amendment. It ends with education.",

My parents lawyered up, Bailed me out 3 days or so later. It ended when her story kept changing and I had no wounds on my hands or face the night I was booked.  Can go much deeper in to the story but I won\u2019t bore y\u2019all. It was scary. She knew my address, phone number (land line back then) my vehicle, my overall everything. I was at my GF\u2019s house after school, did some day boozing, walked 2 blocks home, and went to bed. Then I was \u201cwoken up\u201d about 4 hours later. Lots of people I\u2019ve told the story too have said \u201cI\u2019ve had handled it this way\u201d. But I was woken up from a dead sleep, completely confused, 3 cops screaming at me, my dad freaking out, my mom in hysterics. \n\nThere were no consequences for the accuser. I moved across country for school and that was it. That was around \u201889 or \u201890. Fucking sucked.",

She eventually came clean, but the damage was done - the dude had mugshots, and was arrested in the middle of a crowded bar.  she didn't get so much as a slap on the wrist.  From what I understand, the guy was just so happy to have the charges dropped against him.  But he should have pressed charges against her for the damage she did to him.  \n\nThis was about 20 years ago that this happened.  and I still worry about how I was just a few months away from being 'the guy' in this story.",
