She's braindead because of that. They aren't just keeping her on life support to incubate the fetus, they KILLED HER in order to incubate the fetus."

For example, it counts ectopic pregnancies \u2013 when an embryo implants somewhere other than the uterine lining \u2013 as a serious complication.\n\nMifepristone does not cause an ectopic pregnancy and taking it will not harm someone with an ectopic. It also claims that needing an in-clinic procedure to complete the abortion is a complication, when patients are counseled in advance about the pills\u2019 failure rate of about 3 to 4%.\n\n**The data, the authors say, means the FDA should reinstate earlier restrictions on mifepristone, including a ban on telemedicine and limiting use to the first seven weeks of pregnancy \u2013 but they do not intend to stop there.**\n\nThe authors note that restoring the limits could lead to better monitoring that could help \u201cdetermine whether this drug should remain on the market\u201d, statements that echo proposals found in Project 2025, the 900-page playbook published by the Heritage Foundation and for which the EPPC was an advisory board member.\n\n**Project 2025 calls to end telemedicine prescriptions of abortion pills as an \u201cinterim step\u201d to revoking mifepristone\u2019s approval altogether.**\n\nMore than 100 scientific studies have found the medications cited in the paper are safe and effective for ending a pregnancy.",
