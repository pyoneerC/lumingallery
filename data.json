The man showed a lack of respect for the victim's physical, psychological and sexual boundaries. However, he is still young and has no criminal record. He is also a talented and committed person both in his professional and private live. By finding him guilty but not punishing him, he will be made to feel guilty and the chance of him reoffending will be prevented, without socially impairing the man\u201d.\n\n\"Its **unacceptable**! But I won't punish him.\"",
                "Unfortunately, the title must exactly match the article, so I couldn\u2019t emphasize that the medical student is actually A GYNAECOLOGY RESIDENT!!!!!!! In other words, while the man is young and talented, the woman he raped\u2014and the women who will be vulnerable and naked alone with him in his practice\u2014apparently are not. :)\n\n\nA similar thing occurred a few years ago in the same belgian courthouse when white elite student club called Reuzegom left their only black member, Sanda Dia, for dead after subjecting him to hours of torture as part of an initiation ritual. He eventually died, and the perpetrators tried to cover their tracks. The verdict was the same: they were found guilty but did not receive any sentencing besides a very low fine of \u20ac400 and some community service (in Belgium, you only get a criminal record if there's an actual sentence and the fine needs to exceed X amount which wasn't the case here so they still have clean records) because they were considered \u201cyoung and promising.\u201d In reality, they were white, wealthy, and one of their fathers was a judge in the same court. A YouTuber who doxxed them was fined \u20ac20K\u2014roughly equivalent to 22K dollars\u2014because it is illegal to publish the names of individuals who do not have a criminal record.",
