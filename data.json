Officials said the operation was open-ended and expected to expand. The White House said it had been consulted and voiced support for Israel\u2019s actions.\n\n>The Israeli military ordered people to evacuate eastern Gaza and head toward the center of the territory, indicating that Israel could soon launch renewed ground operations. The new campaign comes as aid groups warn supplies are running out two weeks after Israel cut off all food, medicine, fuel and other goods to Gaza\u2019s 2 million Palestinians.\n\n>[\u2026]\n\n>Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry said the strikes killed at least 404 people and wounded more than 560.
