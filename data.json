She was a single mother when she got a bachelor\u2019s degree in developmental psychology and when she discovered she couldn\u2019t earn enough to pay off her loans, she went back to school and got a master\u2019s degree. Her salary never caught up. Things only got worse.\nAround 2008, when she consolidated her loans, she was paying $1,000 a month, but years of missed payments and piled-on interest meant she was barely putting a dent in a bill that had ballooned to $250,000. When she sought help to resolve her debt, she says the loan company had just one suggestion.\n\u201cThey said, \u2018Move to a cheaper state,\u2019\u201d says Farro, who rents a 400-square-foot casita from a friend. \u201cI realized I was living in a different reality than they were.\u201d\n\nI think most people agree with their original obligation to pay their student loans. The problem is the debt often becomes predatory and they've barely made a dent in the principal after decades. That's when people start seeing education debt as a major issue in need of reform.",
