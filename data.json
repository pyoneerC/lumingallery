Specifically some boat captain around Indonesia. \n\nAssuming the reports that the people were beaten, stabbed, and suffered various other injuries, they absolutely are owed some justice, but going after Bumble Bee Foods in this specific instance seems like an effort to go after the deeper pockets. Now, if they have evidence Bumble Bee knew about these practices and didn't cut ties with the company, then that would definitely change things. Of course the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act doesn't really make a distinction between whether you knew someone you were doing business with was doing something illegal. \n\nI just hope the people who did the actual beating and stabbing were subjected to the full extent of the law.",

                "Thank goodness these workers are getting the chance to fight back. Full context for this would take way too much time to explain (I've contributed to a 40-page paper on human rights violations in the seafood industry), so here's a very basic summary. The seafood industry is wrought with criminal activity ranging from theft/misrepresentation to forced labor/genuine slavery. Bumble Bee and their parent company, FCF, are some of the biggest abusers of modern-day slavery.\n\nThe common practice is to hire a ship from another country (usually China, Taiwan, or the Phillipines). That ship hires laborers in a country that has lots of cheap labor (usually Indonesia or Cambodia). Once these people are hired and on the ship, the ship goes out to sea for months, if not years. These workers are stuck without any way to contact their homes and no guarantee that their wages are getting to their families. They're forced to work long hours in unsafe and unsanitary conditions with just enough food to keep them alive. I am not exaggerating when I say complaints are often met with a beating or a bullet to the head. After all that, if the ship does finally dock (which is often delayed due to transshipment and is often only happening for repairs or changing flags at ports of convenience), the workers aren't allowed onto shore or they might get [abandoned in a foreign country](https://apnews.com/article/abandoned-seafarers-labor-unpaid-wages-oceans-83ad0a42debbaf67c18373393fcea753).\n\nOn top of all this, going back to the recruiting process, most honest recruitment agencies know about this and do what they can to prevent people from getting enslaved. So, the companies that are doing this are often connected to organized crime or terrorist organizations. Corruption is a major issue in Indonesia, [especially in their seafood industry](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-11-27/rolex-watches-seized-as-indonesian-minister-arrested-corruption/12922796). Fighting back against this is extremely risky.\n\nThese workers are extremely brave as they're potentially facing corruption in multiple countries, organized crime, and massive corporations. Going after Bumble Bee will be difficult as the US doesn't have many laws that can be used to make Bumble Bee liable for human rights violations down its supply chain. If we had many laws for this, Nestl\u00e9 would've been taken down a long time ago. The contents of the article detail the abuse they faced but didn't clarify the nationality of the captain and registry of the ship. I hope the best for these workers.\n\nAlso, I haven't looked into human rights groups addressing the seafood industry in Indonesia, but if you'd like to help, I recommend [Destructive Fishing Watch - Indonesia](https://dfw.or.id/english-page/).They support workers and fisheries in adopting sustainable fishing practices while providing on the ground resources to those caught in human rights abuses. When I worked with them, they were a little more on the environmental side of things, but it looks like they've been successful in expanding their efforts to organize and represent laborers. Their 2024 report outlines some of the success they've had addressing human rights violations as part of their second strategy. Give them some love so they can keep fighting the good fight!",

Now, if they have evidence Bumble Bee knew about these practices and didn't cut ties with the company, then that would definitely change things. Of course the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act doesn't really make a distinction between whether you knew someone you were doing business with was doing something illegal. \n\nI just hope the people who did the actual beating and stabbing were subjected to the full extent of the law.",

                "Thank goodness these workers are getting the chance to fight back. Full context for this would take way too much time to explain (I've contributed to a 40-page paper on human rights violations in the seafood industry), so here's a very basic summary. The seafood industry is wrought with criminal activity ranging from theft/misrepresentation to forced labor/genuine slavery. Bumble Bee and their parent company, FCF, are some of the biggest abusers of modern-day slavery.\n\nThe common practice is to hire a ship from another country (usually China, Taiwan, or the Phillipines). That ship hires laborers in a country that has lots of cheap labor (usually Indonesia or Cambodia). Once these people are hired and on the ship, the ship goes out to sea for months, if not years. These workers are stuck without any way to contact their homes and no guarantee that their wages are getting to their families. They're forced to work long hours in unsafe and unsanitary conditions with just enough food to keep them alive. I am not exaggerating when I say complaints are often met with a beating or a bullet to the head. After all that, if the ship does finally dock (which is often delayed due to transshipment and is often only happening for repairs or changing flags at ports of convenience), the workers aren't allowed onto shore or they might get [abandoned in a foreign country](https://apnews.com/article/abandoned-seafarers-labor-unpaid-wages-oceans-83ad0a42debbaf67c18373393fcea753).\n\nOn top of all this, going back to the recruiting process, most honest recruitment agencies know about this and do what they can to prevent people from getting enslaved. So, the companies that are doing this are often connected to organized crime or terrorist organizations. Corruption is a major issue in Indonesia, [especially in their seafood industry](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-11-27/rolex-watches-seized-as-indonesian-minister-arrested-corruption/12922796). Fighting back against this is extremely risky.\n\nThese workers are extremely brave as they're potentially facing corruption in multiple countries, organized crime, and massive corporations. Going after Bumble Bee will be difficult as the US doesn't have many laws that can be used to make Bumble Bee liable for human rights violations down its supply chain. If we had many laws for this, Nestl\u00e9 would've been taken down a long time ago. The contents of the article detail the abuse they faced but didn't clarify the nationality of the captain and registry of the ship. I hope the best for these workers.\n\nAlso, I haven't looked into human rights groups addressing the seafood industry in Indonesia, but if you'd like to help, I recommend [Destructive Fishing Watch - Indonesia](https://dfw.or.id/english-page/).They support workers and fisheries in adopting sustainable fishing practices while providing on the ground resources to those caught in human rights abuses. When I worked with them, they were a little more on the environmental side of things, but it looks like they've been successful in expanding their efforts to organize and represent laborers. Their 2024 report outlines some of the success they've had addressing human rights violations as part of their second strategy. Give them some love so they can keep fighting the good fight!",

Now, if they have evidence Bumble Bee knew about these practices and didn't cut ties with the company, then that would definitely change things. Of course the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act doesn't really make a distinction between whether you knew someone you were doing business with was doing something illegal. \n\nI just hope the people who did the actual beating and stabbing were subjected to the full extent of the law.",

                "Thank goodness these workers are getting the chance to fight back. Full context for this would take way too much time to explain (I've contributed to a 40-page paper on human rights violations in the seafood industry), so here's a very basic summary. The seafood industry is wrought with criminal activity ranging from theft/misrepresentation to forced labor/genuine slavery. Bumble Bee and their parent company, FCF, are some of the biggest abusers of modern-day slavery.\n\nThe common practice is to hire a ship from another country (usually China, Taiwan, or the Phillipines). That ship hires laborers in a country that has lots of cheap labor (usually Indonesia or Cambodia). Once these people are hired and on the ship, the ship goes out to sea for months, if not years. These workers are stuck without any way to contact their homes and no guarantee that their wages are getting to their families. They're forced to work long hours in unsafe and unsanitary conditions with just enough food to keep them alive. I am not exaggerating when I say complaints are often met with a beating or a bullet to the head. After all that, if the ship does finally dock (which is often delayed due to transshipment and is often only happening for repairs or changing flags at ports of convenience), the workers aren't allowed onto shore or they might get [abandoned in a foreign country](https://apnews.com/article/abandoned-seafarers-labor-unpaid-wages-oceans-83ad0a42debbaf67c18373393fcea753).\n\nOn top of all this, going back to the recruiting process, most honest recruitment agencies know about this and do what they can to prevent people from getting enslaved. So, the companies that are doing this are often connected to organized crime or terrorist organizations. Corruption is a major issue in Indonesia, [especially in their seafood industry](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-11-27/rolex-watches-seized-as-indonesian-minister-arrested-corruption/12922796). Fighting back against this is extremely risky.\n\nThese workers are extremely brave as they're potentially facing corruption in multiple countries, organized crime, and massive corporations. Going after Bumble Bee will be difficult as the US doesn't have many laws that can be used to make Bumble Bee liable for human rights violations down its supply chain. If we had many laws for this, Nestl\u00e9 would've been taken down a long time ago. The contents of the article detail the abuse they faced but didn't clarify the nationality of the captain and registry of the ship. I hope the best for these workers.\n\nAlso, I haven't looked into human rights groups addressing the seafood industry in Indonesia, but if you'd like to help, I recommend [Destructive Fishing Watch - Indonesia](https://dfw.or.id/english-page/).They support workers and fisheries in adopting sustainable fishing practices while providing on the ground resources to those caught in human rights abuses. When I worked with them, they were a little more on the environmental side of things, but it looks like they've been successful in expanding their efforts to organize and represent laborers. Their 2024 report outlines some of the success they've had addressing human rights violations as part of their second strategy. Give them some love so they can keep fighting the good fight!",
