                "Brown was driving a vehicle with Robyn F. as the front passenger on an unknown street in Los Angeles. Robyn F. picked up Brown's cellular phone and observed a three-page text message from a woman who Brown had a previous sexual relationship with.\n\n\nA verbal argument ensued and Brown pulled the vehicle over on an unknown street, reached over Robyn F. with his right hand, opened the car door and attempted to force her out. Brown was unable to force Robyn F. out of the vehicle because she was wearing a seat belt. When he could not force her to exit, he took his right hand and shoved her head against he passenger window of the vehicle, causing an approximate one-inch raised circular contusion.\n\n\nRobyn F. turned to face Brown and he punched her in the left eye with his right hand. He then drove away in the vehicle and continued to punch her in the face with his right hand while steering the vehicle with his left hand. The assault caused Robyn F.'s mouth to fill with blood and blood to splatter all over her clothing and the interior of the vehicle.\n\n\nBrown looked at Robyn F. and stated, 'I'm going to beat the sh-- out of you when we get home! You wait and see!'\n\n\nThe detective said \"Robyn F.\" then used her cell phone to call her personal assistant Jennifer Rosales, who did not answer.\n\n\nRobyn F. pretended to talk to her and stated, 'I'm on my way home. Make sure the police are there when I get there.'\n\n\nAfter Robyn F. faked the call, Brown looked at her and stated, 'You just did the stupidest thing ever! Now I'm really going to kill you!'\n\n\nBrown resumed punching Robyn F. and she interlocked her fingers behind her head and brought her elbows forward to protect her face. She then bent over at the waist, placing her elbows and face near her lap in [an] attempt to protect her face and head from the barrage of punches being levied upon her by Brown.\n\n\nBrown continued to punch Robyn F. on her left arm and hand, causing her to suffer a contusion on her left triceps (sic) that was approximately two inches in diameter and numerous contusions on her left hand.\n\n\nRobyn F. then attempted to send a text message to her other personal assistant, Melissa Ford. Brown snatched the cellular telephone out of her hand and threw it out of the window onto an unknown street.\n\n\nBrown continued driving and Robyn F. observed his cellular telephone sitting in his lap. She picked up the cellular telephone with her left hand and before she could make a call he placed her in a head lock with his right hand and continued to drive the vehicle with his left hand.\n\n\nBrown pulled Robyn F. close to him and bit her on her left ear. She was able to feel the vehicle swerving from right to left as Brown sped away. He stopped the vehicle in front of 333 North June Street and Robyn F. turned off the car, removed the key from the ignition and sat on it.\n\n\nBrown did not know what she did with the key and began punching her in the face and arms. He then placed her in a head lock positioning the front of her throat between his bicep and forearm. Brown began applying pressure to Robyn F.'s left and right carotid arteries, causing her to be unable to breathe and she began to lose consciousness.\n\n\nShe reached up with her left hand and began attempting to gouge his eyes in an attempt to free herself. Brown bit her left ring and middle fingers and then released her. While Brown continued to punch her, she turned around and placed her back against the passenger door. She brought her knees to her chest, placed her feet against Brown's body and began pushing him away. Brown continued to punch her on the legs and feet, causing several contusions.\n\n\nRobyn F. began screaming for help and Brown exited the vehicle and walked away. A resident in the neighborhood heard Robyn F.'s plea for help and called 911, causing a police response. An investigation was conducted and Robyn F. was issued a Domestic Violence Emergency Protective Order.",

He beat his father with the claw end of a hammer and a baseball bat and stabbed his mother. He tried to make it look like a robbery in hopes he would get his part of their $2.2 million estate, prosecutors said.\n\n>Robertson has fired his lawyers before. Not long after he arrived on death row he wanted to drop his appeals after a card playing buddy never appealed his death sentence for setting a van on fire with his daughter inside outside his ex-wife\u2019s house.\n\nThe man murdered his parents and he misses his deceased death-row friends, so maybe the state should just go along with it.",

Once the state wrongly executes someone, we all own that.\n\nIn this instance, if he wants to speed it up and admits to his guilt or at least doesn\u2019t fight to claim he is innocent. Let him.",
                "He needs representation to ensure the state follows the law and he is accorded his full rights. It\u2019s not about him at this point, it\u2019s about ensuring protection to those in state custody.",

Holy shit.\n\nThe last time I read about this, it was a woman who cut a ladies baby out of her belly and left her to die",
                "Judges don't like dealing with pro se defendants, and that is half the reason they don't like it when people waive their right to counsel. \n\nIf this guy wants to go ahead and check out, I don't see what the problem is. Are his attorneys ethically barred from pursuing the objective of hastening his execution?\n\nOr is there a material reason to believe he isn't competent to make that call, beyond the fact that our system presumes the decision to be dubious?",
                "The death penalty is barbaric in all cases.",
                "Wonder if he ends up taking the matter into his own hands",
                "He wants to die.\n\nThe best thing to do would be to commute his sentence to life without parole. \n\nThat is not only cheaper, but more intense a punishment."

The way that worked is, the school would send me a list of their students to print out each day, and the kids signed next to their name each day for credit. The school would forget to add students all the time, so we would have the kids pen their name in a extra space and sign next to it. \n\nOne day a young man showed up and said he was a new student at the local highschool. I didn't have anything to do with their enrollment so I assumed he was. Over the course of two months he stripped down and rebuilt this old Cadillac he brought in. \n\nHe was a model student the entire time. \n\nHe was super polite, funny, safe and professional. He would round up other kids to get them to help him, teach them what he was doing, checked out tools the proper way, kept his workplace clean, dressed properly and signed-in every day without fail. \nHe passed every written test the first time and did everything required of him. Until he got that Cadillac running, then he and the car vanished. \n\n\nWhen I asked the school's main office if they knew anything about him, they said they had no idea who he was. Then I asked the other teacher in the program if he knew anything, he thought I signed him up.\n\nThis guy was an absolute phantom, not even the police department knew anything. I still wonder who the hell he was.",
