Accusations alone could lead to detention and deportation.\n\nLack of Due Process \u2013 The Alien Enemies Act does not require the government to prove an individual\u2019s involvement in criminal activity before deportation. Historically, this law has been applied broadly during wartime with minimal legal recourse.\n\nCitizenship Risks \u2013 While the order officially applies to non-citizen Venezuelans, enforcement errors, profiling, and lack of oversight could easily result in U.S. citizens being detained if accused of association with TdA.\n\nPolitical Weaponization \u2013 The vague criteria and emergency framing could enable selective enforcement, disproportionately targeting certain immigrant communities or political opponents.\n\n\nI'm as white bread as they come, born in Nebraska.

                "#Vanishing History: Arlington Cemetery Erases Stories of Black and Female Veterans\n\nSomething strange is happening at Arlington National Cemetery. The sprawling burial ground, where hundreds of thousands of American veterans rest, has quietly erased large chunks of its history from public view. Information about black, Hispanic and female service members, once readily available on its website, has vanished. The pages once told the stories of men and women who broke barriers and gave their all for a country that did not always give back. Now, with a few clicks, they are simply gone.\n\nThe move is part of President Donald Trump's sweeping effort to rid the US military and federal government of diversity, equity and inclusion policies. His administration has been swift in shutting down initiatives that highlight the contributions of minority groups, and Arlington has not been spared.\n\nVisitors looking for details about notable graves have run into dead ends. The pages once dedicated to figures such as General Colin Powell, the first black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the legendary Tuskegee Airmen, the country's first black military pilots, have disappeared. The same goes for Hector Santa Anna, a World War II hero and decorated bomber pilot. Even broader categories of history have been stripped away. Sections on African American, Hispanic and Women's history are no longer easily accessible from the main site.\n\nOfficially, Arlington insists it is working to restore some of the missing content, though it also says it wants to ensure everything aligns with Trump's executive orders and the policies of Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth. Hegseth, a former Fox News host and military veteran, has been vocal about his desire to root out what he calls \u201cwoke\u201d culture from the armed forces. He was instrumental in removing General CQ Brown, the first black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who had supported diversity efforts.\n\nThe backlash has already begun. Representative Adam Smith, a senior Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, called the situation \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and suggested there was never a problem with diversity in the military to begin with. Earlier this year, a similar attempt to remove training materials on the Tuskegee Airmen sparked national outrage, forcing the Pentagon to reverse course.\n\nThe US military today is a complex institution, with more than two million people serving in active duty or reserves. A significant portion of them come from minority backgrounds. Thirty per cent identify as black, Native American or other underrepresented groups, while nearly one-fifth are women. The stories now missing from Arlington's website belong to people who paved the way for them.\n\nHistory cannot be deleted as easily as a webpage. The soldiers buried at Arlington, no matter their background, are not just names etched into headstones. They were real people who lived, fought and sacrificed. Whether or not their stories remain in an online archive, their contributions cannot be erased. But the question remains, why is their history being buried once again?",

                "The press and politicians have been storytelling the crap out of this. This is what facts sound like when you don't do that:\n\nButch and Suni arrived to the ISS with the Starliner CFT mission in June, 2024. It was then decided that due to the issues with Starliner, they shouldn't return on that spacecraft. Starliner undocked on September 6th and returned to Earth safely. SpaceX Crew-9 docked on September 29th. Butch and Suni did not have dedicated seats for an emergency return between September 6th and 29th. In the event of an emergency, requiring the evacuation of the ISS, they would have returned on Crew-8, strapped to a cargo pallette in the Crew Dragon spacecraft. As mentioned before, Crew-9 docked on September 29th, carrying a crew of only two instead of four, hence giving Butch and Suni dedicated seats and duties as crew on that mission with a planned return to Earth in February, 2025. In the event of an emergency, Crew-9 could have returned any time. The planned return in February, 2025 had to be delayed to likely late April, 2025, as SpaceX was unable to complete the new Dragon C213 spacecraft for the Crew-10 mission in time. A direct handover between crew is a high priority, so Crew-10's launch delay would also delay Crew-9's return. Crew-10 launched yesterday, with less delays than initially expected, due to the fact that the Dragon spacecraft was swappped to C210. Crew-10 will be on the ISS for around 6 months. Crew-9 is now scheduled to return no earlier than March 19th.",
                "I really REALLY wish that this politicized \"stranded\" storyline was not repeated so often.\n\nThey have not at any time been \"stranded\".  \nWhen it was shown that there were issues with Starliner, the two were consulted and both they and Nasa decided to change the crew rotation in such a way that they got to spend extra time on station.  \nThey were never stranded, they have been part of an extended crew stay that is now coming to it's preconceived end.\n\nThis was in no way a 'rescue mission' just as much as they were never 'stranded'.\n\nThe truth matters, despite people not agreeing these days.",
                "They aren't stranded, their ride home arrived back in September with 2 astronauts onboard. The same spacecraft will depart in a week or so with 4 astronauts aboard and thus keeping the expedition crew sizes at normal levels to keep the station properly and fully manned."

During WW2.\n\n\nThe main concerns are as follows:\n\nPresumption of Membership \u2013 The order assumes that membership in TdA makes someone an \"Alien Enemy,\" but it does not specify how membership is determined. Accusations alone could lead to detention and deportation.\n\nLack of Due Process \u2013 The Alien Enemies Act does not require the government to prove an individual\u2019s involvement in criminal activity before deportation. Historically, this law has been applied broadly during wartime with minimal legal recourse.\n\nCitizenship Risks \u2013 While the order officially applies to non-citizen Venezuelans, enforcement errors, profiling, and lack of oversight could easily result in U.S. citizens being detained if accused of association with TdA.\n\nPolitical Weaponization \u2013 The vague criteria and emergency framing could enable selective enforcement, disproportionately targeting certain immigrant communities or political opponents.\n\n\nI'm as white bread as they come, born in Nebraska. Under the statute as written, if someone really had it in for me.... Could accuse *me* of being part of TdA... And I won't even get the chance to say adios before I'm shipped to wherever the hell they decide to send me.

Depending on where it happens the other 'side' will point and laugh, but when it happens in the red states it will be far worse, as those states are already essentially federal welfare states and the feds are cutting of what little lifeline they had. If we're not united as a country anymore, ok fine, then we need to redraw the borders, but if we still are we need to be there to help our neighbors when this happens because apparently our government isn't able or willing to anymore."

It\u2019s about her passion for education and students.\n\n>\u201cI love the area that I teach,\u201d she says in an interview with TODAY.com. \u201cIt\u2019s really a valuable thing for people to know our human history, things that humans have accomplished, our time on this earth, things that they\u2019ve overcome, patterns that exist.\u201d\n\n>Five years ago, when she first put up the two signs, it was to make sure students knew they were in an open and welcoming space.\u00a0Now, she says she is risking her job in the name of those values.\n\n>Inama says the controversy began in January when her principal and vice principal came to her classroom to inform her that two posters on her walls were controversial and needed to be removed, a detail the district verified in an email to TODAY.com. Inama says other teachers were given similar instruction, but she was caught off guard by the directive.\n\nGood for her for refusing to back down from the \"controversial\" view that *Everyone is welcome here.*",

The teacher's sign only echoes their official policy of inclusion and respect, so either they're lying (they don't actually believe everyone deserves respect and/or inclusion), or they're just suppressing individual speech. There's zero wiggle room here.\n\n\nMy opinion? My guess is they're lying. We know very well that Jim Crow, segregation, and the KKK were the official responses to emancipation. They were legislated into the closet, forced to use dog whistles. Now they're getting comfy and coming back out.\n\n\n\"Red and yellow, black and white, they are precious in his sight.
