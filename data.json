                "Before the madness of this current admin, they just didn\u2019t let you in. That\u2019s all. Back in the 2000s, we were picking up a travel athlete from Slovenia who didn\u2019t have a return ticket. He was held by CBP in the airport until he bought one. That\u2019s all that happened. They released him as soon as he had the ticket. He wasn\u2019t deported.",

                "When will this madness stop?",
                "The issue isn't that they were questioned, detained and then flown overseas. If they were had been treated courteously and professionally, as you expect from a supposed first world country, this wouldn't have been newsworthy. Its how they were treated. Instead they were treated like this:\n\n>\"After hours of questioning at Honolulu Airport, they said they were placed in handcuffs, loaded into a transport vehicle, and brought to what they later learned was a deportation detention facility.\"\n\n>\"There, they reported being subjected to full-body scans, strip searches, and issued green prison uniforms. They were placed in a holding cell overnight alongside long-term detainees, including individuals accused of serious crimes.\"\n\n>\"Conditions described included sleeping on thin, moldy mattresses, using rudimentary toilets, and being warned by guards to avoid expired food.\"",

I didn't have a paper ticket because I flew with an airline that lets you use their app instead.\n\nWhen I finally got interviewed in the holding pen and explained the guy at the main desk wouldn't let me show him the ticket on my phone, the next guy just rolled his eyes and let me go.",
                "I posted this in another sub when someone asked why/how their accommodations were deemed insufficient, copying and pasting here. I should also note their planned trip was for 5 weeks between Hawai\u2019i and California if that matters for anyone. Also, please remember I was answering a question about why the lodging was considered insufficient and how that led to deportation, not defending the policy and actions: \n\nI live in Hawai\u2019i and the backpackers posted their side of the story on Reddit (available in the backpackers sub). \n\nBasically they only booked for a few days out of their planned trip, with the intention of booking additional as needed. However, they didn\u2019t have the funds on them or something (it\u2019s not clear, they were just asked about how they were going to pay) and when asked how they\u2019ll cover the expense they said they work through virtual employment internationally. They also didn\u2019t have a return flight/connecting flights within the US booked, but they did have an onward flight to Asia booked. \n\nThis flagged them as coming to the country to work illegally and they were deported as a result.\n\nNot defending them being deported or how they were deported but they weren\u2019t aware how strict immigration is for the US and due to their more relaxed travel style in terms of planning, they accidentally answered wrongly (but honestly) in all the wrong places when asked. Even the German consulate got involved but I\u2019m unsure what degree that plays in anything.\n\nThey were sent to Japan instead of Germany because I believe they requested it.",
