                "Good on the activists who stole them and the guy who helped. This artist is nuts. What an awful person.\n\n This just seems extra cruel for no real end game, like its not going to stop anyone from anything, it was suffering for the sake of \"art\".",

                "This is not art it\u2019s animal cruelty",
                "&gt; Chilean-born Marco Evaristti said he had been aiming to raise awareness of the suffering caused by mass meat production with his art installation that opened last week in Copenhagen. The piglets were being denied food and water and would have been allowed to starve to death.\n\nI don't think the way to advocate against animal cruelty, is to cause more animal cruelty. Especially when you're subjecting a creature to a slow death that is initially pretty agonizing.",
                "Suffering for his art is probably a good thing. Replace the missing pigs in the cage with the artist - maybe it will make the same point.",
                "It is kind of interesting that everyone is very upset by this but not upset when it is done in factory farms. I think that is the point of this. Not defending it but I wish some of you would reflect on how this mirrors industrial farming techniques.",
                "I\u2019m inclined to think this artist is actually a psychopath.  Performing animal cruelty to point out other people\u2019s cruelty is certainly a choice.",
                "There was an artist a while back who did something like this with a dog. Guillermo Vargas brought in a starving street dog from outside and had it in the art gallery for 3 hours - the gallery reported that he did feed it food and water while it was there, before it \"escaped.\" Guests were shocked and complained about it, and the artist's point was basically, it's the same dog you walked past outside but didn't give a shit about.",
                "I'm going out on a limb here and braving the wall of downvotes.\n\n\nThe provocation artist achived what he wanted without harming the piglets. They were never starved, they were not even showcased.\n\n\nYet he managed to upset so many people, that it sparked an outrage highlighting the fact most people don't give two shits about animals dying, as long as they are out of sight. What can be more artful than getting people to reflect on issues they normally wouldn't?\n\n\nThe comments in this post are beyond disappointing and shows they have no grasp on art at all.",
                "Maybe, just maybe, the theft of the piglets is all part of the art exhibition. I\u2019m not sure this is the case given that the exhibition opened last week. \n\nIf the intention was to allow three piglets to die from thirst there is a special place in hell for the artist. \n\n\u201cChilean-born Marco Evaristti said he had been aiming to raise awareness of the suffering caused by mass meat production with his art installation that opened last week in Copenhagen. The piglets were being denied food and water and would have been allowed to starve to death.\u201d\n\nThey wouldn\u2019t have starved to death, they would have died of thirst."
