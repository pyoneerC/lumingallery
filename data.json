You probably remember him. Steven Reed made national headlines a few years back as the first black man elected Mayor of Montgomery, once the home of the Confederacy. What they *didn\u2019t* tell you, is that he\u2019s the son of one of Montgomery\u2019s most corrupt politicians in recent times. As of late, it\u2019s clear the Apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the questionably sourced political donations. \n\nI have it on good authority that Reed wants to make a shot at Congress, and his blatant disregard for the growing violence in his city probably won\u2019t help him.",

                "Police are waiting for forensic results to see if he was killed in any of the other shootings.",
                "> At least five people were shot in the Capital City in a two-hour span, including Samuel Giles, 25, of Montgomery, who died from his injuries.\n\nI feel for the people. It has to be incredibly scary to have no answers, and to wonder if this is a pattern of shootings that will continue.",
                "Montgomery resident here. Or, I was as of a few months ago. Montgomery has a serious problem with gang violence, and our dear mayor refuses to acknowledge it. You probably remember him. Steven Reed made national headlines a few years back as the first black man elected Mayor of Montgomery, once the home of the Confederacy. What they *didn\u2019t* tell you, is that he\u2019s the son of one of Montgomery\u2019s most corrupt politicians in recent times. As of late, it\u2019s clear the Apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the questionably sourced political donations. \n\nI have it on good authority that Reed wants to make a shot at Congress, and his blatant disregard for the growing violence in his city probably won\u2019t help him.",
                "It's deeply unsettling to hear about this string of violent events, and it's particularly troubling to think that they might *not* be related, given the lack of identified motives, I hope authorities can quickly find answers, because honestly, it's hard to believe that so much tragedy can happen without any clear connection.",
                "You're not supposed to be able to do that in a small town and guns prevent gun deaths in deep red Alabama.",
                "Just another day in the land of the freedumb.",
                "It's genuinely heartbreaking to hear about this awful chain of incidents in Montgomery, and frankly, the city needs some serious support, it's just awful., and a focus on preventing this kind of violence so everyone can feel safe, because, really, it shouldn't happen.",
                "I drove through Montgomery and got a hotel room two years ago at a decent place while traveling to FL and the lady at the hotel said I am so thankful you stopped here and not the other exit. She said it\u2019s dangerous. She was the sweetest. You don\u2019t know what is bad or good in cities but I picked the best exit to stop for sure.",
