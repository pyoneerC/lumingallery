In some cases, the Medicare/Medicaid payment falls below the actual cost of delivering care. Rural hospitals are also more often located in states that refused Medicaid expansion through Obamacare, which means patients who carry no insurance whatsoever.\n\nAt the same time, these hospitals have higher expenses. Rural hospitals struggle to recruit and retain staff, leading to higher labor costs per-patient. Increasingly, they rely on travel nurses or contract physicians to fill the gaps, both of which are more expensive than their traditional staffing counterparts. They also suffer from higher debt loads, costs from deferred maintenance, and antiquated equipment, all of which raise costs.\n\nNaturally, the planned cuts to government healthcare will exacerbate these problems.
