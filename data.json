Considering the available evidence, the additional public health risk\n\nposed by NB.1.8.1 is evaluated as low at the global level. Currently approved COVID-19 vaccines are expected\n\nto remain effective to this variant against symptomatic and severe disease. Despite a concurrent increase in\n\ncases and hospitalizations in some countries where NB.1.8.1 is widespread, current data do not indicate that\n\nthis variant leads to more severe illness than other variants in circulation.",
