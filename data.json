The reason the doctors prefer to do a mastectomy is because it's easy to miss some cancer cells doing a lumpectomy and then the cancer can return. Sure enough, they missed some and the cancer came roaring back. Only this time it spread well beyond her breasts, and by the time they realized it was back it had spread to inoperable areas. She has to do a monthly chemo pill to keep it under control and is constantly having to chase the newest treatment once hers stops working. Recently her hair all fell out, after decades of hanging on. We are very lucky to still have her after 20 years post diagnosis, but this cancer will kill her. She is only in her early 60's. We should have another 20 years with her but I don't think she will be able to beat the cancer for that long given her recent decline.

                "Aluminum is really a fascinating thing as it's really pretty recent that we've had the means to extract it.  Bauxite is quite common but extracting the metals from the ore is very difficult.  So difficult that until we figured out how to use electrolysis to do it, the price of aluminum was higher than that of gold.  The common story that is told (I'm unsure how factually accurate it is) was that Napoleon the third would use aluminum flatware at banquets while other dignitaries would use gold cutlery.\n\nWith electrolysis, extraction of aluminum ( and gallium as well, but gallium is not as useful in general applications) from bauxite became easier and the process has only improved.  The process was invented only in 1890s.  The main issue with it being that it does require quite a lot of electricity, which is why Canada produces a lot of it.  They have abundant hydro electric power to perform the electrolysis process fairly inexpensively.",

Regional economic growth and much higher demand have consumed the once abundant cheap power, and caused all of the legacy aluminum plants to close.",

But they are falling short of their primary goal: to revive domestic aluminum production.\nInstead, rising costs, particularly skyrocketing electricity prices in the U.S. relative to global competitors, are leading to smelter closures rather than restarts.\n\nAdding even more financial stress on an already struggling population.",

There's little structural awareness: whether it's sourcing raw/semi processed materials, setup investment costs, or ancillary infrastructure, there's broad issues which blanket tariffs are actually doing more to impede new manufacturing rather than encourage it. Not to mention attacking international goodwill which reduces demand for American products, and increases demand for competitors' products.",

                "Aluminum is really a fascinating thing as it's really pretty recent that we've had the means to extract it.  Bauxite is quite common but extracting the metals from the ore is very difficult.  So difficult that until we figured out how to use electrolysis to do it, the price of aluminum was higher than that of gold.  The common story that is told (I'm unsure how factually accurate it is) was that Napoleon the third would use aluminum flatware at banquets while other dignitaries would use gold cutlery.\n\nWith electrolysis, extraction of aluminum ( and gallium as well, but gallium is not as useful in general applications) from bauxite became easier and the process has only improved.  The process was invented only in 1890s.  The main issue with it being that it does require quite a lot of electricity, which is why Canada produces a lot of it.  They have abundant hydro electric power to perform the electrolysis process fairly inexpensively.",
                "A local (NW US) aluminum smelter closed a few years ago. It was built in the 1950\u2019s and hadn\u2019t been significantly modernized. Periodic plans to reopen it by investment funds have involved large government subsidies and non-existent cheap subsidized power.\n\nUltra cheap hydroelectric power in the NW US has been gone for many years. Regional economic growth and much higher demand have consumed the once abundant cheap power, and caused all of the legacy aluminum plants to close.",
                "> Sweeping tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump on imported aluminum are reshaping global trade flows and inflating costs for American consumers. But they are falling short of their primary goal: to revive domestic aluminum production.\nInstead, rising costs, particularly skyrocketing electricity prices in the U.S. relative to global competitors, are leading to smelter closures rather than restarts.\n\nAdding even more financial stress on an already struggling population.",
                "That's fundamentally what's wrong with this tariff policy. They want to bring back low profit industries (seemingly just out of nostalgia), while they could be focusing on sectors that they already have competitive advantages (like AI).

There's little structural awareness: whether it's sourcing raw/semi processed materials, setup investment costs, or ancillary infrastructure, there's broad issues which blanket tariffs are actually doing more to impede new manufacturing rather than encourage it. Not to mention attacking international goodwill which reduces demand for American products, and increases demand for competitors' products.",

                "Aluminum is really a fascinating thing as it's really pretty recent that we've had the means to extract it.  Bauxite is quite common but extracting the metals from the ore is very difficult.  So difficult that until we figured out how to use electrolysis to do it, the price of aluminum was higher than that of gold.  The common story that is told (I'm unsure how factually accurate it is) was that Napoleon the third would use aluminum flatware at banquets while other dignitaries would use gold cutlery.\n\nWith electrolysis, extraction of aluminum ( and gallium as well, but gallium is not as useful in general applications) from bauxite became easier and the process has only improved.  The process was invented only in 1890s.  The main issue with it being that it does require quite a lot of electricity, which is why Canada produces a lot of it.  They have abundant hydro electric power to perform the electrolysis process fairly inexpensively.",
                "A local (NW US) aluminum smelter closed a few years ago. It was built in the 1950\u2019s and hadn\u2019t been significantly modernized. Periodic plans to reopen it by investment funds have involved large government subsidies and non-existent cheap subsidized power.\n\nUltra cheap hydroelectric power in the NW US has been gone for many years. Regional economic growth and much higher demand have consumed the once abundant cheap power, and caused all of the legacy aluminum plants to close.",
                "> Sweeping tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump on imported aluminum are reshaping global trade flows and inflating costs for American consumers. But they are falling short of their primary goal: to revive domestic aluminum production.\nInstead, rising costs, particularly skyrocketing electricity prices in the U.S. relative to global competitors, are leading to smelter closures rather than restarts.\n\nAdding even more financial stress on an already struggling population.",
                "That's fundamentally what's wrong with this tariff policy. They want to bring back low profit industries (seemingly just out of nostalgia), while they could be focusing on sectors that they already have competitive advantages (like AI). It's literally wasting energy with something less profitable",

                "Trump's claims and behavior shows policies that assumes the only thing preventing manufacturing growth in the US is overly competitive pricing. There's little structural awareness: whether it's sourcing raw/semi processed materials, setup investment costs, or ancillary infrastructure, there's broad issues which blanket tariffs are actually doing more to impede new manufacturing rather than encourage it. Not to mention attacking international goodwill which reduces demand for American products, and increases demand for competitors' products.",
