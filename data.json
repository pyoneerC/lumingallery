                ">An Idaho teacher is in a standoff with her own school district after officials ordered her to remove classroom signs, including one that reads, \u201cEveryone is welcome here.\u201d\u00a0\n\n>Sarah Inama, a sixth-grade history teacher at Lewis and Clark Middle School in Meridian, Idaho, says she won\u2019t comply with the order, arguing that the message is a fundamental part to ensuring a positive learning environment for her students.\n\n>Inama, who has taught at the school for five years, says her commitment to inclusivity isn\u2019t about politics. It\u2019s about her passion for education and students.\n\n>\u201cI love the area that I teach,\u201d she says in an interview with TODAY.com. \u201cIt\u2019s really a valuable thing for people to know our human history, things that humans have accomplished, our time on this earth, things that they\u2019ve overcome, patterns that exist.\u201d\n\n>Five years ago, when she first put up the two signs, it was to make sure students knew they were in an open and welcoming space.\u00a0Now, she says she is risking her job in the name of those values.\n\n>Inama says the controversy began in January when her principal and vice principal came to her classroom to inform her that two posters on her walls were controversial and needed to be removed, a detail the district verified in an email to TODAY.com. Inama says other teachers were given similar instruction, but she was caught off guard by the directive.\n\nGood for her for refusing to back down from the \"controversial\" view that *Everyone is welcome here.*",

                "#Vanishing History: Arlington Cemetery Erases Stories of Black and Female Veterans\n\nSomething strange is happening at Arlington National Cemetery. The sprawling burial ground, where hundreds of thousands of American veterans rest, has quietly erased large chunks of its history from public view. Information about black, Hispanic and female service members, once readily available on its website, has vanished. The pages once told the stories of men and women who broke barriers and gave their all for a country that did not always give back. Now, with a few clicks, they are simply gone.\n\nThe move is part of President Donald Trump's sweeping effort to rid the US military and federal government of diversity, equity and inclusion policies. His administration has been swift in shutting down initiatives that highlight the contributions of minority groups, and Arlington has not been spared.\n\nVisitors looking for details about notable graves have run into dead ends. The pages once dedicated to figures such as General Colin Powell, the first black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the legendary Tuskegee Airmen, the country's first black military pilots, have disappeared. The same goes for Hector Santa Anna, a World War II hero and decorated bomber pilot. Even broader categories of history have been stripped away. Sections on African American, Hispanic and Women's history are no longer easily accessible from the main site.\n\nOfficially, Arlington insists it is working to restore some of the missing content, though it also says it wants to ensure everything aligns with Trump's executive orders and the policies of Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth. Hegseth, a former Fox News host and military veteran, has been vocal about his desire to root out what he calls \u201cwoke\u201d culture from the armed forces. He was instrumental in removing General CQ Brown, the first black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who had supported diversity efforts.\n\nThe backlash has already begun. Representative Adam Smith, a senior Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, called the situation \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and suggested there was never a problem with diversity in the military to begin with. Earlier this year, a similar attempt to remove training materials on the Tuskegee Airmen sparked national outrage, forcing the Pentagon to reverse course.\n\nThe US military today is a complex institution, with more than two million people serving in active duty or reserves. A significant portion of them come from minority backgrounds. Thirty per cent identify as black, Native American or other underrepresented groups, while nearly one-fifth are women. The stories now missing from Arlington's website belong to people who paved the way for them.\n\nHistory cannot be deleted as easily as a webpage. The soldiers buried at Arlington, no matter their background, are not just names etched into headstones. They were real people who lived, fought and sacrificed. Whether or not their stories remain in an online archive, their contributions cannot be erased. But the question remains, why is their history being buried once again?"

                "#Vanishing History: Arlington Cemetery Erases Stories of Black and Female Veterans\n\nSomething strange is happening at Arlington National Cemetery. The sprawling burial ground, where hundreds of thousands of American veterans rest, has quietly erased large chunks of its history from public view. Information about black, Hispanic and female service members, once readily available on its website, has vanished. The pages once told the stories of men and women who broke barriers and gave their all for a country that did not always give back. Now, with a few clicks, they are simply gone.\n\nThe move is part of President Donald Trump's sweeping effort to rid the US military and federal government of diversity, equity and inclusion policies. His administration has been swift in shutting down initiatives that highlight the contributions of minority groups, and Arlington has not been spared.\n\nVisitors looking for details about notable graves have run into dead ends. The pages once dedicated to figures such as General Colin Powell, the first black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the legendary Tuskegee Airmen, the country's first black military pilots, have disappeared. The same goes for Hector Santa Anna, a World War II hero and decorated bomber pilot. Even broader categories of history have been stripped away. Sections on African American, Hispanic and Women's history are no longer easily accessible from the main site.\n\nOfficially, Arlington insists it is working to restore some of the missing content, though it also says it wants to ensure everything aligns with Trump's executive orders and the policies of Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth. Hegseth, a former Fox News host and military veteran, has been vocal about his desire to root out what he calls \u201cwoke\u201d culture from the armed forces. He was instrumental in removing General CQ Brown, the first black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who had supported diversity efforts.\n\nThe backlash has already begun. Representative Adam Smith, a senior Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, called the situation \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and suggested there was never a problem with diversity in the military to begin with. Earlier this year, a similar attempt to remove training materials on the Tuskegee Airmen sparked national outrage, forcing the Pentagon to reverse course.\n\nThe US military today is a complex institution, with more than two million people serving in active duty or reserves. A significant portion of them come from minority backgrounds. Thirty per cent identify as black, Native American or other underrepresented groups, while nearly one-fifth are women. The stories now missing from Arlington's website belong to people who paved the way for them.\n\nHistory cannot be deleted as easily as a webpage. The soldiers buried at Arlington, no matter their background, are not just names etched into headstones. They were real people who lived, fought and sacrificed. Whether or not their stories remain in an online archive, their contributions cannot be erased. But the question remains, why is their history being buried once again?"

It\u2019s about her passion for education and students.\n\n>\u201cI love the area that I teach,\u201d she says in an interview with TODAY.com. \u201cIt\u2019s really a valuable thing for people to know our human history, things that humans have accomplished, our time on this earth, things that they\u2019ve overcome, patterns that exist.\u201d\n\n>Five years ago, when she first put up the two signs, it was to make sure students knew they were in an open and welcoming space.\u00a0Now, she says she is risking her job in the name of those values.\n\n>Inama says the controversy began in January when her principal and vice principal came to her classroom to inform her that two posters on her walls were controversial and needed to be removed, a detail the district verified in an email to TODAY.com. Inama says other teachers were given similar instruction, but she was caught off guard by the directive.\n\nGood for her for refusing to back down from the \"controversial\" view that *Everyone is welcome here.*",

                "#Vanishing History: Arlington Cemetery Erases Stories of Black and Female Veterans\n\nSomething strange is happening at Arlington National Cemetery. The sprawling burial ground, where hundreds of thousands of American veterans rest, has quietly erased large chunks of its history from public view. Information about black, Hispanic and female service members, once readily available on its website, has vanished. The pages once told the stories of men and women who broke barriers and gave their all for a country that did not always give back. Now, with a few clicks, they are simply gone.\n\nThe move is part of President Donald Trump's sweeping effort to rid the US military and federal government of diversity, equity and inclusion policies. His administration has been swift in shutting down initiatives that highlight the contributions of minority groups, and Arlington has not been spared.\n\nVisitors looking for details about notable graves have run into dead ends. The pages once dedicated to figures such as General Colin Powell, the first black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the legendary Tuskegee Airmen, the country's first black military pilots, have disappeared. The same goes for Hector Santa Anna, a World War II hero and decorated bomber pilot. Even broader categories of history have been stripped away. Sections on African American, Hispanic and Women's history are no longer easily accessible from the main site.\n\nOfficially, Arlington insists it is working to restore some of the missing content, though it also says it wants to ensure everything aligns with Trump's executive orders and the policies of Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth. Hegseth, a former Fox News host and military veteran, has been vocal about his desire to root out what he calls \u201cwoke\u201d culture from the armed forces. He was instrumental in removing General CQ Brown, the first black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who had supported diversity efforts.\n\nThe backlash has already begun. Representative Adam Smith, a senior Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, called the situation \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and suggested there was never a problem with diversity in the military to begin with. Earlier this year, a similar attempt to remove training materials on the Tuskegee Airmen sparked national outrage, forcing the Pentagon to reverse course.\n\nThe US military today is a complex institution, with more than two million people serving in active duty or reserves. A significant portion of them come from minority backgrounds. Thirty per cent identify as black, Native American or other underrepresented groups, while nearly one-fifth are women. The stories now missing from Arlington's website belong to people who paved the way for them.\n\nHistory cannot be deleted as easily as a webpage. The soldiers buried at Arlington, no matter their background, are not just names etched into headstones. They were real people who lived, fought and sacrificed. Whether or not their stories remain in an online archive, their contributions cannot be erased. But the question remains, why is their history being buried once again?"

That should be bare minimum in a country that prides itself on consumerism and wealth.\u00a0\n\nInstead, this single dad working two jobs can't send his kid on a trip *so that a bunch of obscenely rich fucking assholes who can already afford anything they want or need can make themselves wealthier.*\n\nFucked country. Completely fucked.",
                "So I just had a thought, back with Biden when people were feeling things were expensive (eggs excluded - bird flu), maybe some of it was because people were feeling confident enough to even consider the more luxurious options? People would say \u201cI have more money in my pocket but I don\u2019t feel like it buys as much.\u201d People had a good economy for so long that they forgot what it was REALLY like to have to worry about their financial fragility. \n\nIt\u2019s like vaccines, we are the victims of our own success.",

                "The real effects are starting. It's not an immediate collapse, it's not groceries going back to normal, home prices aren't going to correct this month. \n\nYou're setting up everyone below 40 to become frugal. To fear economic uncertainty even when the economy is \"growing healthily.\" \n\n2 generations of frugal consumers with a constant paranoia that their life is going to be stripped down at a moments notice. \n\nWe're being offered 200k homes for 550k with interest. The average car payment is close to becoming the average mortgage payment in the 90s. Minimum wage hasn't changed, college degrees don't guarantee success, and our leaders don't give a shit unless they get a profit. \n\nI wanted to get out of school and live on the beach, have a sports car, basically the standard kids' idea of success. Now, I just want a small home without paying absurd taxes. I want a chicken coop and garden. Even that is a monumental feat for a single person.  \n\nWhy are my taxes going up more and more while we all receive so much less? We pay 10% less taxes than Germany. We receive less protections from employers. 0 guarantee of vacation. Our Healthcare is more expensive and worse than Germany. We pay considerably more for home loans. Our roads are worse, our police are worse, our food is worse, are homes are built worse, our infrastructure is failing, we have companies paying 250k fines for poisoning entire towns. \n\nOur leaders have decided that every citizen under the top 10% will now pay more taxes as a way to maintain our fabulously vile standard of living. \n\nI just want out. I have to be in this country for just less than a decade. I'm not sure I want a house here anymore. I'd rather save, finish another degree, and leave. This rat race is a joke.",
