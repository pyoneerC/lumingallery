                "I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever noticed what a barista was wearing aside from if they had an apron on or a hat of some sort.",
                "**Summary:**\n\nOver 1,000 Starbucks baristas at 75 U.S. stores have gone on strike since Sunday to protest a new dress code requiring solid black shirts and khaki, black, or blue denim bottoms.\n\nPreviously, employees could wear more varied dark colors and patterns. \n\nStarbucks says the change is meant to make its green apron more distinctive and create a more welcoming atmosphere.\n\nHowever, Starbucks Workers United, the union representing employees at 570 company-owned stores, argues that the policy should be negotiated as part of collective bargaining.\n\nWorkers also criticized the company for selling now-banned clothing styles on its internal site.\n\nStarbucks stated the strike has had minimal impact and criticized the union for not prioritizing contract negotiations.\n\nThe union has filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board.",
                "Hate when I try to order a coffee but none of the workers clothing makes their aprons color pop and I don't feel welcome and have to have a screaming mental breakdown",

                "I can't believe someone out there is being paid 90 million a year to think up stupid shit like this",
                "Enforcing a strict dress code is a good way to lose good managers and employees.  Managers have to become micro managers and employees get constantly criticized.  It's just not worth it.",
                "They don't even want people drinking their drinks in the store anymore. Why the fuck should customers care how \"inviting\" baristas look? Starbucks corporate wants us out of their stores.",
                "It's very simple: whatever your opinion is on the dress code and it's validity, the union is arguing that the company doesn't have the right to change the dress code without prior consent from the union.\n\n\nThis is simply a case of the union looking out for workers the way it's supposed to, and it wouldn't matter if the dress code was changed to clown shoes and a clown car or to outlaw the color the Puce. The union is arguing that they need to be consulted and negotiated with no matter what the change is.\n\n\nThey are not dying on the hill of the dress code. They are dying on the hill of the rights of the union to collective bargaining.\u00a0",
                "Buying new clothes for dress codes was one of the most stressful parts of working a retail job with a dress code. \n\nWhen I was making $10 and hour and my pants became worn, it was beyond stressful."

Tim Walz, the Minnesota National Guard, Mayor Jacob Frey and Hennepin County Sheriff Dawanna Witt have all been briefed on preparations for possible civil unrest if President Donald Trump pardons former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin for his federal conviction of killing George Floyd.\n\n> Then, on Monday, when asked about the possibility of a pardon, Gov. Walz told reporters, \u201cNo indication whether they\u2019re going to do it, or not, but I think it behooves us to be prepared for it. With this presidency, it seems like something they would do.\u201d\n\nSo it doesn't sound like Trump or the White House have said anything concrete, but there seem to be *rumors* circulating of a potential pardon which is what is causing this preparation.\n\nThe good news: Trump can only pardon him on federal crimes, not the state ones. Chauvin still has a 22 year sentence to serve in Minnesota even if he is pardoned federally.",

Thus tens of millions of people get different I information, news, facts, truths, etc than tens of millions of others. \n\nThat is the ONLY way you achieve what this nation has in the past decade. \n\nThirty years ago, Trump would have been laughed out of the 2015 primaries. \n\nBut after 30+ years (starting in the 1990s) of partisan based escalating Culture War for profit, by the time the \u201cage of information\u201d took hold half the country was just ready and waiting for an anti-lib media ecosystem. \n\nThey had Rush and Fox News and in the days before the World Wide Web was truly ubiquitous that was more than enough to make billions off culture war. But it wasn\u2019t enough to truly alter/diverge realities. The way information traveled was still \u201cslow\u201d. Outlets, regardless of lean were all still covering the same basic news stories. Average Americans may have had bias one way or the other, but they still all got more or less the same basic information from which to understand the world. \n\nBut that stopped being true once the flood gates of digital media opened, and they technology of targeted advertising became the number one business model in the digital age. \n\nThe barrier of entry was lowered so much that millions could start a blog, a community, or a \u201cnew media\u201d company. Better yet, there are nearly no rules to how you create and spread information online. Your voice, for free, can carry equal weight to a press outlet that has to pay researchers, editors, reporters, fact checkers, and journalists. Your voice can EARN as much as outlets that  have basic news gathering and reporting standards and practices. \n\nThere was never a version of this world where real news gathering/reporting and real journalism were ever going to survive in the face of millions of people who can just blast their opinions and hot takes. Especially when ad sales platforms do not care what those opinions and hot takes are. Especially when millions of people don\u2019t care if what they say is accurate, true, or even in good faith. \n\nAnd all of the above is BEFORE social media, with its engagement and personalization algos, and it\u2019s built in incentives to create and spread as much content as possible. \n\nWE\n\nARE\n\nBROKEN",

How this couple (assuming they are parents but it doesn't specifically say so) could do that do another human being is unfathomable.
