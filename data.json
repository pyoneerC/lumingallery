Most people signed up for this debt as teenagers with little financial literacy, and student loan debt can be shockingly predatory. I don't think many of these people anticipated it becoming a millstone around their neck for decades. College enrollment is going to decrease as newer generations fear the impact of education debt.

Wallace included a photo of Ellis, and the post went viral, the lawsuit states.  \nWallace deleted that original post, according to the lawsuit, and then shared two others linking Ellis to the crash. One referred to an interview that Ellis did with The Smerconish Podcast, in which she said President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order barring trans people from serving and enlisting in the military made her nervous. \nThe second post included photos of Ellis and said she might have participated in \u201canother trans terror attack,\u201d according to the lawsuit. That post received 4.8 million views on X, the suit states.\n\n\nSlandering someone for a non-existent terrorist attack absolutely deserves a lawsuit.

And of course, mostly white dudes. \n\nThere is *absolutely zero* correlation between a person's gender or race and their ability to fly an airplane, make critical decisions during a flight, or manage resources.\n\nActually, I take that back. Women were generally better at studying and were less likely to take risks. The worst students were usually rich old men. \n\nAirlines **do not** hire under-performing candidates to meet \"DEI quotas.\" Everyone has to perform to the same standard. Sure, there may be initiatives to help those who have been subjected to an industry with a deeply ingrained \"good ol' boy\" tradition, but not at the expense of safety, performance, and quality. You either meet the standards, or you don't.\n\nThese cowards hide behind DEI and say stuff like \"Ohh I just don't like these woke hiring practices that allow under-qualified people in, women can be perfectly fine pilots too!\" But that's *bullshit.* They are cowards who refuse to say it with their chest. They think women can't be pilots. They think black people can't be pilots. They think trans people can't be pilots. It's fucking horseshit and they are sad little pussies who are too afraid to be openly sexist and racist.\n\nTake it from me, an *actual professional* with years of experience in the industry.

I taught hundreds of students from recreational private pilots, up through commercial pilots and flight instructors. I taught many women, people of color, and even one trans person (that I knew of). And of course, mostly white dudes. \n\nThere is *absolutely zero* correlation between a person's gender or race and their ability to fly an airplane, make critical decisions during a flight, or manage resources.\n\nActually, I take that back. Women were generally better at studying and were less likely to take risks. The worst students were usually rich old men. \n\nAirlines **do not** hire under-performing candidates to meet \"DEI quotas.\" Everyone has to perform to the same standard. Sure, there may be initiatives to help those who have been subjected to an industry with a deeply ingrained \"good ol' boy\" tradition, but not at the expense of safety, performance, and quality. You either meet the standards, or you don't.\n\nThese cowards hide behind DEI and say stuff like \"Ohh I just don't like these woke hiring practices that allow under-qualified people in, women can be perfectly fine pilots too!\" But that's *bullshit.* They are cowards who refuse to say it with their chest. They think women can't be pilots. They think black people can't be pilots. They think trans people can't be pilots. It's fucking horseshit and they are sad little pussies who are too afraid to be openly sexist and racist.\n\nTake it from me, an *actual professional* with years of experience in the industry.

                "A jury found Nadine Menendez guilty on all counts in a bribery case in which prosecutors said she was a \u201ccritical participant\u201d in the five-year fraud with her husband,\u00a0former U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez, as they accepted cash, gold bars and a luxury car from three New Jersey men looking for help with business dealings or legal woes.\n\nThe jury began considering the charges against the 58-year-old on Friday in Manhattan federal court. They returned the guilty verdict late Monday afternoon on all 15 counts she faced, including bribery, conspiracy, obstruction of justice, working as a foreign agent and more.\n\nMenendez, wearing a pink facemask, stood beside her defense attorney as the verdict was read following the three-week trial. Sentencing was scheduled for June 12.\n\nShe was found guilty in the same federal courthouse in Manhattan where a different jury convicted her husband of many of the same charges in 2024. He was not in the courthouse for Monday's guilty verdict.\n\nHer husband, the 71-year-old former senator, is set to report to prison in June to begin an 11-year sentence. He stepped down from his Senate post after his conviction. Repeatedly during the trial, prosecutors said Bob and Nadine Menendez were \u201cpartners in crime,\" detailing the timeline of the whirlwind romance between the couple that began in early 2018 and continued after criminal charges were brought against them in Sept. 2023.\n\nBoth Nadine and Bob Menendez said they are innocent and never took any bribes.",

                "> On Jan. 30, less than 24 hours after the crash, conservative influencer Matt Wallace, who has 2.2 million followers on the social media platform X, shared a post from another account he operates stating that the helicopter pilot was transgender, according to the lawsuit. Wallace included a photo of Ellis, and the post went viral, the lawsuit states.  \nWallace deleted that original post, according to the lawsuit, and then shared two others linking Ellis to the crash. One referred to an interview that Ellis did with The Smerconish Podcast, in which she said President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order barring trans people from serving and enlisting in the military made her nervous. \nThe second post included photos of Ellis and said she might have participated in \u201canother trans terror attack,\u201d according to the lawsuit. That post received 4.8 million views on X, the suit states.\n\n\nSlandering someone for a non-existent terrorist attack absolutely deserves a lawsuit. I hope they end up having to pay a massive amount of money. That's a great way to have her be targeted by death threats and possibly physical attacks. Imagine joining the National Guard for almost 20 years, then some ass does this to you.",

I taught hundreds of students from recreational private pilots, up through commercial pilots and flight instructors. I taught many women, people of color, and even one trans person (that I knew of). And of course, mostly white dudes. \n\nThere is *absolutely zero* correlation between a person's gender or race and their ability to fly an airplane, make critical decisions during a flight, or manage resources.\n\nActually, I take that back. Women were generally better at studying and were less likely to take risks. The worst students were usually rich old men. \n\nAirlines **do not** hire under-performing candidates to meet \"DEI quotas.\" Everyone has to perform to the same standard. Sure, there may be initiatives to help those who have been subjected to an industry with a deeply ingrained \"good ol' boy\" tradition, but not at the expense of safety, performance, and quality. You either meet the standards, or you don't.\n\nThese cowards hide behind DEI and say stuff like \"Ohh I just don't like these woke hiring practices that allow under-qualified people in, women can be perfectly fine pilots too!\" But that's *bullshit.* They are cowards who refuse to say it with their chest. They think women can't be pilots. They think black people can't be pilots. They think trans people can't be pilots. It's fucking horseshit and they are sad little pussies who are too afraid to be openly sexist and racist.\n\nTake it from me, an *actual professional* with years of experience in the industry.
