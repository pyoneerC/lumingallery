If each sailing was carrying 8,000 to 10,000 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units), that would equal a decline in freight traffic of between 640,000-800,000 containers, and lead to decreased crane operations at the ports, lower fees that could be collected, and declines in container pick-ups and transports by trucks, rails, and to warehouses for storage.\n\nThe World Trade Organization warned on Wednesday that the outlook for global trade has \u201cdeteriorated sharply\u201d in the wake of Trump\u2019s tariffs plan.
