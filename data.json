A solid third of my cases were bullshit weed and custody cases that no one cared about. There just weren't enough resources to care about this.\n\nAnother third was abject poverty and people living in falling apart plywood trailers with no plumbing or electricity in the middle of Texas summer. Obviously you can't have a newborn baby living in 110\u00b0 shed. Usually for that we would cram them in with the very unwilling family member and call it a day. There wasn't enough money to do anything else. \n\nA third of my cases were teen parents who didn't know any better and often didn't care but sometimes were trying. It's hard to be 15 and have a baby of your own when you're living on someone's couch. We usually got another unwilling family member to help supervise in these situations and called it a day. There wasn't enough money to do anything else. \n\nIn a perfect world I would have gotten them all affordable housing and healthcare and birth control and education and government IDs and bus passes and nutrition and clothes and sooooooo muchhhhhh therapyyyyyyy. \n\nA small portion of my cases were absolute monsters who needed to be locked up and so many of them escaped any sort of actual punishment. Again because of resources. \n\nVery frequently we terminated rights for shit parents but that's usually because the parents didn't even make an effort to complete the court required programs they were ordered to do. Simple stuff like parenting classes and showing up to visits and paying $10 a month in child support. Half the time they didn't even show up. I would tell them in person and in writing and tell the attorney \"hey this person has court on this date if they want to continue being a parent they need to show up.\" Nothing.\n\nParents who actually made even a half-assed effort got their kids back unless they were complete monsters like incest/rapists.",

NSW Police are currently facing a class action over this. So far around 3000 people have signed up. A trial for that class action began today, hence the article.\n\nFor background: In 2001, New South Wales (state in Australia, Sydney is the capital) introduced a law giving police the power to deploy drug detection dogs at certain public locations, namely at major events such as music festivals, train stations and at venues that serve alcohol, such as pubs and clubs. These dogs are notoriously unreliable, and there are reports on social media of handlers forcing their dogs to sit in front people in order to have them searched.\n\nMusic festivals are the worst. The police have drug detection dogs at every music festival in Sydney. At these events, they\u2019ll have a fenced off compound setup with makeshift structures such as tents or ticket booths where people stopped by the dogs are taken to be searched. Some people are lucky enough to get away with a pat down, but in many cases, festival attendees have been ordered to strip completely naked and bend over, squat etc. to have their bodies examined for drugs. At any given event, they\u2019ll strip search dozens of people like this. Total gestapo stuff and it\u2019s still happening today.",

                "It\u2019s noteworthy that the Trump administration is continuing the legal defense of mifepristone access initiated under President Biden. Given Trump\u2019s previous statements about not planning to ban or restrict the drug, this move aligns with his earlier position. However, with ongoing legal challenges from Republican-led states like Missouri, Kansas, and Idaho, the future of mifepristone\u2019s accessibility remains uncertain.\n\n\u201cLast year, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a bid by anti-abortion groups and doctors to restrict access to the drug, finding that they lacked legal standing to challenge the FDA regulations.\n\nThose plaintiffs dropped their case after the high court ruling, but U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee, allowed the states to intervene and continue to pursue the lawsuit.\u201d",
                "I hear the sound of MAGA heads exploding\u2026",
                "This news literally does not signal any change in political stance on the future of medication abortion in the US, unlike what some people are saying. The bottom line is, Trump doesn\u2019t need this lawsuit to succeed, since he can accomplish what the conservative plaintiff states want by simply directing his FDA to take steps to remove the drug. See Josh Hawley\u2019s recent statements about a bogus new \u201cstudy\u201d of the drug, teeing up the pretext for RFK Jr to order new FDA reviews. Trump can also just order his DOJ to enforce the Comstock Act to prevent distribution of the pill. But abandoning the jurisdictional arguments in this case could create other issues\u2014one of which is if the red states succeed in keeping this case alive, then it could result in precedent in the 5th circuit that could benefit blue state plaintiffs that want to bring future suits on the same standing and venue grounds. If anything, this filing shows Trump\u2019s DOJ lawyers aren\u2019t ready to completely ignore the judiciary and legal precedent, just yet anyway."

                "*Article Text by Hayden Field:*\n\nOpenAI has bowed to pressure from civic leaders and ex-employees, announcing in a blog post on Monday that its nonprofit would retain control of the company even as it restructures into a public benefit corporation.\n\nThe company, which is backed by Microsoft\n and was recently valued at $300 billion in a funding round led by SoftBank, said it made the decision after discussing the matter with the attorneys general of California and Delaware.\n\n\u201cWith the structure we\u2019re contemplating, the not-for-profit will remain in control of OpenAI,\u201d Bret Taylor, OpenAI\u2019s board chairman, said in a video call with reporters. \u201cWe will be converting the limited liability company, that is a subsidiary of that nonprofit, to a public benefit corporation. By doing so, it will change the equity structure of that company so that employees, investors and the not-for-profit can own equity in that PBC.\u201d\n\nTaylor said OpenAI had commissioned outside financial advisors to consult on the recapitalization. He declined to share how much of a stake the nonprofit would have in the company, though it will be a majority.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on the call that he was \u201cvery happy that the nonprofit and the PBC will have the same mission.\u201d He said the board and stakeholders agreed with the decision.\n\nOpenAI is currently engulfed in a heated legal battle with Elon Musk, who co-founded the group as a nonprofit research lab in 2015. Musk is trying to keep OpenAI from converting into a for-profit company as he competes in the generative AI market with his own startup, xAI.\n\nAltman was asked about the dispute on Monday\u2019s call.\n\n\u201cWe are obsessed with our mission and what it takes to fulfill that,\u201d he said. \u201cYou all are obsessed with Elon, that\u2019s your job \u2014 like, more power to you. But we are here to think about our mission and figure out how to enable that. And that mission has not changed.\u201d\n\nLed by Altman, OpenAI has been commercializing products in recent years, most notably its viral ChatGPT chatbot, which was launched in late 2022. The company is still overseen by a nonprofit parent and has faced significant hurdles in its goal to restructure into a for-profit, due largely to Musk. A Musk-led group offered to buy OpenAI in February for $97.4 billion, a bid that was swiftly rejected. \n\nOpenAI\u2019s hybrid structure has included a capped-profit limited partnership that was created in 2019. The original nonprofit is the controlling shareholder and would have been spun out as an independent entity if OpenAI had succeeded in its efforts. With that change no longer taking place, OpenAI\u2019s investors receive convertible notes that will turn into equity.\n\nA group of ex-OpenAI employees, Nobel laureates, law professors and civil society organizations sent a letter last month to attorneys general in California and Delaware requesting that they halt the startup\u2019s restructuring efforts out of safety concerns.\n\nIn the letter, which was delivered to OpenAI\u2019s board, the group wrote that restructuring to a for-profit entity would \u201csubvert OpenAI\u2019s charitable purpose,\u201d and \u201cremove nonprofit control and eliminate critical governance safeguards.\u201d\n\nPage Hedley, OpenAI\u2019s former policy and ethics advisor \u2014 and lead organizer of Not For Private Gain, the group that wrote the letter \u2014 said in a statement that while it\u2019s a positive step that the company is listening to concerns, \u201ccrucial questions remain.\u201d One is around whether OpenAI\u2019s commercial goals will \u201ccontinue to be legally subordinate to its charitable mission,\u201d and another is, \u201cWho will own the technology that OpenAI develops?\u201d said Hedley, who is lead organizer of the group that wrote the letter.\n\nTaylor said on the call with reporters that OpenAI\u2019s current structure includes the nonprofit board and subsidiary, but that the nonprofit board is really the sole governing body. Taylor shared what he called a \u201ctechnical detail\u201d about the board makeup after restructuring\n\nThere will be a separate board for the public benefit corporation, but the nonprofit will appoint those directors, and \u201con day one, we plan on having the same directors for both,\u201d Taylor said.\n\n\u201cFrom a governance standpoint, the mission comes first, because the fiduciary duty of the not-for-profit board is exclusively to that mission,\u201d Taylor said. He said that was one \u201cone of the main pieces of feedback\u201d from recent conversations.\n\nIn a letter to employees that was part of Monday\u2019s blog post, Altman said that OpenAI remains committed to ensuring that artificial general intelligence (AGI), which rivals or surpasses human intelligence, \u201cbenefits all of humanity.\u201d But a lot has changed in the nine years since he co-founded the lab, he said.\n\n\u201cWhen we started OpenAI, we did not have a detailed sense for how we were going to accomplish our mission,\u201d Altman wrote. \u201cWe could not contemplate the direct benefits of AI being used for medical advice, learning, productivity, and much more, or the needs for hundreds of billions of dollars of compute to train models and serve users.\u201d\n\nAltman said OpenAI may still need to pull in trillions of dollars for the resources necessary to \u201cmake our services broadly available to all of humanity.\u201d",

                "Chat lives, for the time being...",
                "The only thing stopping OpenAI from becoming a for-profit are the billionaire vultures fighting over the money. We need to stop letting them act like they caved under the pressure of morality or public pressure. They\u2019re playing the long game."

                "It\u2019s noteworthy that the Trump administration is continuing the legal defense of mifepristone access initiated under President Biden. Given Trump\u2019s previous statements about not planning to ban or restrict the drug, this move aligns with his earlier position. However, with ongoing legal challenges from Republican-led states like Missouri, Kansas, and Idaho, the future of mifepristone\u2019s accessibility remains uncertain.\n\n\u201cLast year, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a bid by anti-abortion groups and doctors to restrict access to the drug, finding that they lacked legal standing to challenge the FDA regulations.\n\nThose plaintiffs dropped their case after the high court ruling, but U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee, allowed the states to intervene and continue to pursue the lawsuit.\u201d",
                "I hear the sound of MAGA heads exploding\u2026",
                "This news literally does not signal any change in political stance on the future of medication abortion in the US, unlike what some people are saying. The bottom line is, Trump doesn\u2019t need this lawsuit to succeed, since he can accomplish what the conservative plaintiff states want by simply directing his FDA to take steps to remove the drug. See Josh Hawley\u2019s recent statements about a bogus new \u201cstudy\u201d of the drug, teeing up the pretext for RFK Jr to order new FDA reviews. Trump can also just order his DOJ to enforce the Comstock Act to prevent distribution of the pill. But abandoning the jurisdictional arguments in this case could create other issues\u2014one of which is if the red states succeed in keeping this case alive, then it could result in precedent in the 5th circuit that could benefit blue state plaintiffs that want to bring future suits on the same standing and venue grounds. If anything, this filing shows Trump\u2019s DOJ lawyers aren\u2019t ready to completely ignore the judiciary and legal precedent, just yet anyway."

                "Police in New York said a town official was arrested over the weekend for shooting a DoorDash delivery driver who was lost and trying to find the right address.\n\nState police said John Reilly, the highway superintendent for the Town of Chester, was arrested on Saturday, the day after allegedly shooting the delivery driver in front of his home. The 48-year-old faces charges of felony assault and weapons possession.\n\nThe shooting happened around 10 p.m. Friday night on Valerie Drive. According to police, the DoorDash driver had become lost and could not locate the correct delivery address.\n\nThe DoorDash worker went door-to-door, asking for directions in hopes of tracking down the correct home, police said. He eventually made it to Reilly's home, where the 48-year-old instructed the man to get off his property.\n\nAfter turning to leave, police allege that Reilly fired \"multiple shots\" at the delivery man. One of the bullets struck him in the back, \"causing seriously physical injuries.\"\n\nDoorDash shared a statement with\u00a0The New York Times, saying the company would work with law enforcement following this \"tragic incident.\"\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re devastated by this senseless act of violence, and we\u2019re wishing the Dasher a full and speedy recovery,\u201d the statement read.\n\nReilly is scheduled to appear in court Friday morning in the Town of Chester Court. Contact information for his attorney was not immediately known.\n\nAccording to police, Reilly is a federally licensed firearms dealer.",

We've seen this play out in town after town, people ask for directions, and get filled with lead for the crime of being on someone's' property. Sometimes they claim self defense, and not a few times they have gotten away with it.\n\nLets' see how this one plays out.
