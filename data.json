                "> Witkoff arrived in Moscow shortly after noon local time on March 13, according to data from the flight tracking website FlightRadar24, and Russian state media broadcast video of his motorcade leaving Vnukovo International Airport shortly after.\n\n> During the group discussion on Signal, Goldberg reported, **Ratcliffe named an active CIA intelligence officer** in the chat at 5:24 p.m. eastern time, which was just after midnight in Russia. Witkoff\u2019s flight did not leave Moscow until around 2 a.m. local time, and Sergei Markov, a former Putin advisor who is still close to the Russian president, said in a Telegram post that **Witkoff and Putin were meeting in the Kremlin until 1:30 a.m.**\n\n\nSeriously, what more is needed to charge these guys with whatever your equivalent of treason is?\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m pretty sure the \u2018VP\u2019 in the chat was not the couch molester, it was Vladimir Putin (only half /s).",
