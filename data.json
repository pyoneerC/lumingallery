Truly heinous.",
                "That photo is this woman pregnant with her FIRST child. \n\nShe was only 8/9 weeks pregnant when she became braindead. That wasn't a viable fetus. They're keeping her body on machines for months and months for the slight chance this baby doesn't die immediately after artificial birth.",
                "And of course she first went to the hospital where she was basically ignored, and now they are throwing everything they can at her to keep her body as an incubator for a baby that, even if it somehow survives, will be thrown to the wolves by the state.",
                "You can't donate the organs of someone who died without their consent but a braindead woman who does not consent to this (nor does her family) must remain an incubator. Corpses have more rights than women. This is fucking shameful. And when the baby is born, then what? The family takes the baby? And who has to pay for all these hospital bills to keep her alive? Like what if they were not in a place financially to do that? This is where the claim that this is \"pro life\" completely falls apart. These people do not give a fuck about anything except controlling the bodies of women. Some days it feels like my anger at this country is going to completely drive me insane.\n\nWomen are not state-sanctioned gestation tanks. Fuck anyone who voted for this administration.",
                "This is a literal plot point from the TV show The Handmaid's Tale, where a brain-dead woman is kept hooked up in a hospital until they can cut the baby out of her. Nice to know that our current society is mirroring an incredibly depressing dystopian hellscape of a show.",
                "Okay, then the state of Georgia should foot the bill for every bit of the medical costs.",
                "How DARE they use that photo while reporting she was 9 weeks pregnant. They\u2019re deliberately misleading the public into thinking this was a full term viable pregnancy rather than what it really is which is the same age most pregnancies fail. This is not only ghoulish on the people responsible but on NBC for this deliberately manipulative reporting. Shame on NBC and I hope you all will spread the word where you can. This has major implications.",
                "Not only has she been brain dead and on life support to maintain her body as an incubator for more than 90 days, she was only nine weeks pregnant so she has another couple of months to go.\n\nMeanwhile, her toddler son doesn\u2019t actually know she\u2019s (brain) dead because he sees his mommy looking asleep so he hasn\u2019t gotten a chance to grieve yet. Her family hasn\u2019t gotten a chance to grieve. Her mother is going to live with this trauma for the rest of her life. \n\nAnd they\u2019re going to get the bill for all of this when they\u2019re finally allowed to let her pass.\n\nThe cruelty is the point, but it\u2019s amazing how often they keep coming up with new ways of being even crueler.",
                "This is some genuine Handmaids Tale shit.",
                "It's even worse than what a lot of posters here are reacting to: there's a good chance that if it weren't for the risks to the pregnancy, the doctors could have intervened with the clots that rendered her braindead, because they mentioned that they had found it in time and were about to try to relieve pressure. She's braindead because of that. They aren't just keeping her on life support to incubate the fetus, they KILLED HER in order to incubate the fetus."
