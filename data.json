                "From [CBS News last week](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/who-will-be-the-next-pope-list-of-possible-candidates/):\n\n> Chicago-born Cardinal Robert Prevost is seen as having many of the qualities desired in a pope, and if elected, he would become the first U.S. pope in the church's history.\n\n> Prevost is the head of the church's Dicastery for Bishops, meaning he oversees the selection of new bishops. It's a powerful position, and for any cardinal electors who may be turned off by his American nationality, it's not his only one. Prevost is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Peru, where he served for many years.\n\n> Overall, **he's considered a centrist**, but on many social issues he's seen as progressive, embracing marginalized groups like Francis, who championed migrants and the poor. But Prevost opposes ordaining women as deacons, for instance, so he's seen as conservative on church doctrine.\n\n> His age could also be a factor \u2014 at 69 some may consider him too young to hold the church's highest office.",

                "This could be a Pope John Paul II situation, where the Pope is elected from a country specifically to contrast and oppose that country's particularly worrisome regime",
                "For those wondering, it's sort of a continuation of the previous Pope's idealogical leanings - champions the poor/migrants but is against ordaining women. He's also a dual US-Peru citizen.",
                "Papal names are often chosen for a reason or to send a message, so it's good to look at what other popes with that name did, as it can often give a hint at the new pope's views. In this case, Leo XIII was famous for issuing one of the Catholic Church's most famous edicts, ***Rerum novarum***, which criticized capitalism for its tendency toward greed, concentration of wealth, and mistreatment of workers. It strongly advocated for organizations like labor unions. At the same time, it also criticized socialism for rejecting private property and the under-emphasis of the importance of the individual."

Bosworth was taken to the hospital, where he died from his injuries. The other person, a juvenile, was treated and released. A third juvenile with them was unharmed, authorities said.\n\nButler, 27, told investigators that he believed the teens were trying to break into his home, NBC Washington reported.\n\nAccording to a search warrant affidavit obtained by NBC News, one of the teens told detectives that they were recording ding-dong ditch pranks for a TikTok video, in which they ring people's doorbells and then run away. The teen said that they had been to a couple of homes in the neighborhood and that he was not familiar with the area.\"\n\nAt 3am? They decide it's a good idea to ring people's doorbells?

It's a powerful position, and for any cardinal electors who may be turned off by his American nationality, it's not his only one. Prevost is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Peru, where he served for many years.\n\n> Overall, **he's considered a centrist**, but on many social issues he's seen as progressive, embracing marginalized groups like Francis, who championed migrants and the poor. But Prevost opposes ordaining women as deacons, for instance, so he's seen as conservative on church doctrine.\n\n> His age could also be a factor \u2014 at 69 some may consider him too young to hold the church's highest office.",

Bosworth was taken to the hospital, where he died from his injuries. The other person, a juvenile, was treated and released. A third juvenile with them was unharmed, authorities said.\n\nButler, 27, told investigators that he believed the teens were trying to break into his home, NBC Washington reported.\n\nAccording to a search warrant affidavit obtained by NBC News, one of the teens told detectives that they were recording ding-dong ditch pranks for a TikTok video, in which they ring people's doorbells and then run away. The teen said that they had been to a couple of homes in the neighborhood and that he was not familiar with the area.\"\n\nAt 3am? They decide it's a good idea to ring people's doorbells? Not saying they should have been shot but how dumb can people be???",

                "From [CBS News last week](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/who-will-be-the-next-pope-list-of-possible-candidates/):\n\n> Chicago-born Cardinal Robert Prevost is seen as having many of the qualities desired in a pope, and if elected, he would become the first U.S. pope in the church's history.\n\n> Prevost is the head of the church's Dicastery for Bishops, meaning he oversees the selection of new bishops. It's a powerful position, and for any cardinal electors who may be turned off by his American nationality, it's not his only one. Prevost is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Peru, where he served for many years.\n\n> Overall, **he's considered a centrist**, but on many social issues he's seen as progressive, embracing marginalized groups like Francis, who championed migrants and the poor. But Prevost opposes ordaining women as deacons, for instance, so he's seen as conservative on church doctrine.\n\n> His age could also be a factor \u2014 at 69 some may consider him too young to hold the church's highest office.",

In this case, Leo XIII was famous for issuing one of the Catholic Church's most famous edicts, ***Rerum novarum***, which criticized capitalism for its tendency toward greed, concentration of wealth, and mistreatment of workers. It strongly advocated for organizations like labor unions. At the same time, it also criticized socialism for rejecting private property and the under-emphasis of the importance of the individual."

Bosworth was taken to the hospital, where he died from his injuries. The other person, a juvenile, was treated and released. A third juvenile with them was unharmed, authorities said.\n\nButler, 27, told investigators that he believed the teens were trying to break into his home, NBC Washington reported.\n\nAccording to a search warrant affidavit obtained by NBC News, one of the teens told detectives that they were recording ding-dong ditch pranks for a TikTok video, in which they ring people's doorbells and then run away. The teen said that they had been to a couple of homes in the neighborhood and that he was not familiar with the area.\"\n\nAt 3am? They decide it's a good idea to ring people's doorbells? Not saying they should have been shot but how dumb can people be???",
