My guess is that one difference will be that patients with autism are more likely to be unvaccinated, due to misinformation.\n\nBad science aside, the most concerning issue mentioned in the article is that a \"new disease registry is being launched to track Americans with autism,\" which is highly alarming. What the hell is this for? The article doesn't say, of course, but there is no scientific rationale to \"register\" Americans with autism."

Dozens made emotional statements during a similar hearing in federal court in 2023 that lasted for three days.\n\n> The people who were killed at Walmart ranged in age from a 15-year-old high school athlete to elderly grandparents. They included immigrants, a retired city bus driver, a teacher, tradesmen including a former iron worker, and several Mexican nationals who had crossed the U.S. border on routine shopping trips.\n\nThose people leave behind a legacy of loved ones who will keep their memories alive. 100 loved ones to share their stories.

                "I scream this into the void whenever this topic comes up, and I will continue doing so:\n\nI was a flight instructor for nearly a decade. I taught hundreds of students from recreational private pilots, up through commercial pilots and flight instructors. I taught many women, people of color, and even one trans person (that I knew of). And of course, mostly white dudes. \n\nThere is *absolutely zero* correlation between a person's gender or race and their ability to fly an airplane, make critical decisions during a flight, or manage resources.\n\nActually, I take that back. Women were generally better at studying and were less likely to take risks. The worst students were usually rich old men. \n\nAirlines **do not** hire under-performing candidates to meet \"DEI quotas.\" Everyone has to perform to the same standard. Sure, there may be initiatives to help those who have been subjected to an industry with a deeply ingrained \"good ol' boy\" tradition, but not at the expense of safety, performance, and quality. You either meet the standards, or you don't.\n\nThese cowards hide behind DEI and say stuff like \"Ohh I just don't like these woke hiring practices that allow under-qualified people in, women can be perfectly fine pilots too!\" But that's *bullshit.* They are cowards who refuse to say it with their chest. They think women can't be pilots. They think black people can't be pilots. They think trans people can't be pilots. It's fucking horseshit and they are sad little pussies who are too afraid to be openly sexist and racist.\n\nTake it from me, an *actual professional* with years of experience in the industry. Not some dipshit podcaster or brainless news personality.",
