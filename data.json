Adult colossal squid are the largest known molluscs (and in fact the largest known invertebrate), at least by weight, but how big they can really get isn\u2019t really known.\n\nColossal Squid are deep-sea animals, and due to not needing air they rarely, if ever come close to the surface- the youngest animals usually live deeper than 500m down, and adults are even larger. Before now, the vast majority of colossal squids found have been dead- IiRC the animal was first described from beaks found in Sperm Whale stomachs, and a few animals have been found since. In the last few decades they have been filmed, but the ones we\u2019ve seen before now have been pulled up by fishing nets- there\u2019s quite a famous video of one that was dragged up while holding on to a Patagonian Toothfish it had caught. Even larger juveniles are *huge,* and the aforementioned squid was still massive. Caught specimens also tend to shrink significantly after death, which makes them difficult to measure.\n\nThey\u2019re often compared with the Giant Squid, but they aren\u2019t closely related. Giant squid might possibly get *longer*, but Colossal Squid are much bulkier/heavier.\n\nFilming one in its natural habitat is such a big deal because it\u2019s our first chance to see how they behave \u201cnormally.\u201d The animal is very poorly known as a result of how difficult it is to observe them (for reference, my area for most of my adult life (so far) was studying squid, I had a special interest in Colossal squid, and *I* barely know anything about them). I\u2019d argue they\u2019re probably one of the most enigmatic animals out there. \n\nI think they\u2019re also often suggested to be the inspiration behind The Kraken, although I\u2019d personally argue depictions of that particular mythological beast always seem to be more like Octopuses (which can still get pretty large, but not to this degree).\n\nHope that explains a bit why people are so excited about this!",

                "Excerpt from Lewis Adams, BBC News - Essex:\n\nA colossal squid has been filmed in its natural environment for the first time since the species was discovered 100 years ago.\n\nThe 30cm-long (11.8in) juvenile was caught on camera at a depth of 600m (1,968ft), near the South Sandwich Islands in the south Atlantic Ocean.\n\nA team of scientists, led by a University of Essex academic, recorded the footage in March during a 35-day quest to find new marine life.\n\nExperts believe colossal squid can grow up to 7m (23ft) in length and weigh up to 500kg (1,100lb) - making them the heaviest invertebrate on the planet.\n\nThe mollusc was discovered on the 100-year anniversary of it first being identified and named.",

                "Hey, malacologist here for anyone confused- \u201ccolossal squid\u201d is the animal\u2019s common name (like \u201cblue whale\u201d or \u201chuman\u201d), rather than a description of this particular animal. Adult colossal squid are the largest known molluscs (and in fact the largest known invertebrate), at least by weight, but how big they can really get isn\u2019t really known.\n\nColossal Squid are deep-sea animals, and due to not needing air they rarely, if ever come close to the surface- the youngest animals usually live deeper than 500m down, and adults are even larger. Before now, the vast majority of colossal squids found have been dead- IiRC the animal was first described from beaks found in Sperm Whale stomachs, and a few animals have been found since. In the last few decades they have been filmed, but the ones we\u2019ve seen before now have been pulled up by fishing nets- there\u2019s quite a famous video of one that was dragged up while holding on to a Patagonian Toothfish it had caught. Even larger juveniles are *huge,* and the aforementioned squid was still massive. Caught specimens also tend to shrink significantly after death, which makes them difficult to measure.\n\nThey\u2019re often compared with the Giant Squid, but they aren\u2019t closely related. Giant squid might possibly get *longer*, but Colossal Squid are much bulkier/heavier.\n\nFilming one in its natural habitat is such a big deal because it\u2019s our first chance to see how they behave \u201cnormally.\u201d The animal is very poorly known as a result of how difficult it is to observe them (for reference, my area for most of my adult life (so far) was studying squid, I had a special interest in Colossal squid, and *I* barely know anything about them). I\u2019d argue they\u2019re probably one of the most enigmatic animals out there. \n\nI think they\u2019re also often suggested to be the inspiration behind The Kraken, although I\u2019d personally argue depictions of that particular mythological beast always seem to be more like Octopuses (which can still get pretty large, but not to this degree).\n\nHope that explains a bit why people are so excited about this!",

                "Hey, malacologist here for anyone confused- \u201ccolossal squid\u201d is the animal\u2019s common name (like \u201cblue whale\u201d or \u201chuman\u201d), rather than a description of this particular animal. Adult colossal squid are the largest known molluscs (and in fact the largest known invertebrate), at least by weight, but how big they can really get isn\u2019t really known.\n\nColossal Squid are deep-sea animals, and due to not needing air they rarely, if ever come close to the surface- the youngest animals usually live deeper than 500m down, and adults are even larger. Before now, the vast majority of colossal squids found have been dead- IiRC the animal was first described from beaks found in Sperm Whale stomachs, and a few animals have been found since. In the last few decades they have been filmed, but the ones we\u2019ve seen before now have been pulled up by fishing nets- there\u2019s quite a famous video of one that was dragged up while holding on to a Patagonian Toothfish it had caught. Even larger juveniles are *huge,* and the aforementioned squid was still massive. Caught specimens also tend to shrink significantly after death, which makes them difficult to measure.\n\nThey\u2019re often compared with the Giant Squid, but they aren\u2019t closely related. Giant squid might possibly get *longer*, but Colossal Squid are much bulkier/heavier.\n\nFilming one in its natural habitat is such a big deal because it\u2019s our first chance to see how they behave \u201cnormally.\u201d The animal is very poorly known as a result of how difficult it is to observe them (for reference, my area for most of my adult life (so far) was studying squid, I had a special interest in Colossal squid, and *I* barely know anything about them). I\u2019d argue they\u2019re probably one of the most enigmatic animals out there. \n\nI think they\u2019re also often suggested to be the inspiration behind The Kraken, although I\u2019d personally argue depictions of that particular mythological beast always seem to be more like Octopuses (which can still get pretty large, but not to this degree).\n\nHope that explains a bit why people are so excited about this!",
