                "Well shit, wish I saw this coming\u2026\n\n\u201cTOKYO, May 12 (Reuters) - Nissan Motor (7201.T) will cut more than 10,000 jobs globally, bringing the number of layoffs, including those previously announced, to about 20,000 or 15% of its workforce, Japan's public broadcaster NHK reported on Monday. Japan's third-biggest automaker is striving to make its business leaner and more resilient after weak sales in China and its biggest market the United States.\n\nNissan declined to comment on the report.\n\nIt is set to announce on Tuesday results for the business year that ended in March. It warned last month it would likely book a record 700 billion yen to 750 billion yen ($4.74 billion-$5.08 billion) net loss in that year due to impairment charges. The car maker missed out on the growing popularity of hybrid models in the United States and failed to capitalise on an early lead in electric vehicles there.\n\nIt has also suffered in China, the world's biggest auto market, where it plans to launch some 10 new vehicles in the coming years to try to halt a slide in sales. CEO Ivan Espinosa, who took over from Makoto Uchida as chief executive last month, is restructuring Nissan's operations and has previously said the company was considering extra measures. Nissan, which had more than 133,000 staff as of March last year, announced plans last November to cut 9,000 jobs and reduce global capacity by 20%. Advertisement \u00b7 Scroll to continue It has also said it would close a plant in Thailand by June and shut two more plants that it has not identified.\n\nOn Friday, it said it had decided to give up a plan to build a $1.1 billion factory, for which it was set to receive government subsidies, for EV batteries on Japan's southwestern island of Kyushu. Its weak performance forced it to cut its profit outlook four times for the financial year that just ended.\u201d",

                "Well shit, wish I saw this coming\u2026\n\n\u201cTOKYO, May 12 (Reuters) - Nissan Motor (7201.T) will cut more than 10,000 jobs globally, bringing the number of layoffs, including those previously announced, to about 20,000 or 15% of its workforce, Japan's public broadcaster NHK reported on Monday. Japan's third-biggest automaker is striving to make its business leaner and more resilient after weak sales in China and its biggest market the United States.\n\nNissan declined to comment on the report.\n\nIt is set to announce on Tuesday results for the business year that ended in March. It warned last month it would likely book a record 700 billion yen to 750 billion yen ($4.74 billion-$5.08 billion) net loss in that year due to impairment charges. The car maker missed out on the growing popularity of hybrid models in the United States and failed to capitalise on an early lead in electric vehicles there.\n\nIt has also suffered in China, the world's biggest auto market, where it plans to launch some 10 new vehicles in the coming years to try to halt a slide in sales. CEO Ivan Espinosa, who took over from Makoto Uchida as chief executive last month, is restructuring Nissan's operations and has previously said the company was considering extra measures. Nissan, which had more than 133,000 staff as of March last year, announced plans last November to cut 9,000 jobs and reduce global capacity by 20%. Advertisement \u00b7 Scroll to continue It has also said it would close a plant in Thailand by June and shut two more plants that it has not identified.\n\nOn Friday, it said it had decided to give up a plan to build a $1.1 billion factory, for which it was set to receive government subsidies, for EV batteries on Japan's southwestern island of Kyushu. Its weak performance forced it to cut its profit outlook four times for the financial year that just ended.\u201d",

In all, about 30 people were rescued.\n\n>Authorities have not said how the fire might have started.\n\n>Lipski said the building did not have a sprinkler system and was built in 1968, predating a law that would have required one, according to the fire chief.\n\n>\u201cIf we had sprinklers in the buidling we would have stopped the fire very, very small. We would not of had to have people jumping out of windows,\u201d he said.\n\n>Several other residents were treated for lesser injuries in the fire that began sometime before 8 a.m. The blaze rendered the 85-unit building uninhabitable, displacing an estimated 200 people.\n\n>James Rubinstein, a resident in the building, said he jumped to the ground floor.\n\n>\u201cThere was so much smoke. I climbed out the courtyard with my cat in my backpack,\u201d Rubinstein told television station FOX6 Milwaukee.\n\n>Emergency operaters received calls that people were trapped and jumping to escape. The first firefighters to arrive were \u201cfar, far outmatched\u201d by intense flames, Lipski said.\n\n>Authorities did not immediately release the identities or ages of the victims. Lipski said the fire began in a common area and spread to multiple floors.\n\n>Eddie Edwards, another resident of the building, said he also jumped to escape.\n\n>\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about nothing but getting away,\u201d he told Milwaukee television station WISN. \u201cGetting out and saving everyone\u2019s life.
