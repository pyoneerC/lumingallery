                "Ok, I guess I need to brace for the downvotes given the current comments here. \n\nHonestly, this is worlds better than an insurance company or some random tech startup with undescribed end goals, guys. This is a legitimate big pharmaceutical company who has a lot of R&D around genetic disease and has made a lot of therapeutic advances. They want the data to develop new therapies, probably ones for genetic based disease. Being the first to do this will make them so much money. That\u2019s their goal here, I think. It\u2019s new massively growing space in R&D. And this much genetic data is research treasure trove for them.\n\nThey are also going to have pre-designed protocols and standards when it comes to handling this data. I know people side eye big pharma (rightfully in most circumstances) but this is a much better outcome than many other situations.\n\nAm I saying don\u2019t delete your data? No. Am I saying this is better than pretty much any other potential buyer? Absolutely.\n\nI also want to add one thing: All the stuff about Trump ties is wild. Pretty much every pharma company (and  many of the academic researchers that Trump is now black listing from NIH funding due to their coronavirus research) got Project Warp Speed funding during the pandemic. Monoclonal antibody treatment was an absolute scientific miracle. So were the other rapid vaccine developments during the pandemic. It saved so many lives.",
