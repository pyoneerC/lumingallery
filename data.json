Browning argues that most of the men of \u00a0RPB 101 were not fanatical\u00a0Nazis but, rather, ordinary middle-aged, working-class men who committed these atrocities out of a mixture of motives, including the group dynamics of conformity, deference to authority, role adaptation, and the altering of moral norms to justify their actions. Very quickly three groups emerged within the battalion: a core of eager killers, a plurality who carried out their duties reliably but without initiative, and a small minority who evaded participation in the acts of killing without diminishing the murderous efficiency of the battalion whatsoever.\n\n>While this book discusses a specific Reserve Unit during WWII, the general argument Browning makes is that most people succumb to the pressures of a group setting and commit actions they would never do of their own volition. \u00a0\n\n>*Ordinary Men*\u00a0is a powerful, chilling, and important work with themes and arguments that continue to resonate today.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, Orpo must stand for Orlando Police",

                "This was 100% preventable, and a result of police and emergency response failures. The killer\u2019s family had made TWO separate 911 calls less than 24 hours before the attack, begging him to be institutionalized or even just taken to a hospital for a psychiatric hold. Vancouver Police determined it was \u201cunnecessary\u201d and \u201cnot a mental health emergency\u201d and did not take him for evaluation by an actual psychiatric professional. Had he been taken to hospital as his family repeatedly begged for, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to do this. \n\nHis brother, a gay makeup artist, was murdered last year. His mother attempted suicide months later, and he absolutely spiralled and had dozens of mental health crises. If they had gotten the care required or if we had actual residential mental health facilities (the ones previous provincial governments closed down to \u201csave taxpayer money\u201d 20 years ago\u2026) we could have had 11 people still alive today. \n\nThinking about how this guy\u2019s family loss 15 months ago led to this, and how we need to make sure the survivors and their families from this killing are not abandoned in the same way and get adequate mental care\n\nOur douchebag wannabe fratboy mayor Ken Sim campaigned on a promise to hire \u201c100 more cops and 100 more mental health nurses\u201d and then proceeded to completely renege on the second, and the 100 cops he hired apparently thought they could do the work of a psychiatrist and decide guys like this didn\u2019t actually need hospital assessment\u2026.",

                "Was this a Filipino targeted attack? Or was he just looking for a random crowd?",
                "What\u2019s especially sad is that there\u2019s an excellent chance that the perpetrator of the attack will be sentenced to a mental health facility. James Brady died from wounds sustained when Ronald Reagan was shot by John Hinckley Jr.  He was judged innocent by reason of insanity and eventually released from the institution. That\u2019s the especially troubling thing is that the punishment of the crime is not commiserate with the tragedy inflicted on the innocent victims. **Yet we as rational people are unable to punish the mentally unstable.** So the greatest tragedy in Vancouvers history may have an inadequate closure for everyone.\n\nEdit: When Ronald Reagan was Governor of California the Supreme Court said that we couldn\u2019t institutionalize the Mentally Ill without their consent or a Court order. So as a result Mental Institutions were closed and the Mentally Unstable released. However there was no provision for them to get out patient care or to receive housing assistance or any of the myriad services needed to be on their own. Thus began the large homeless population we have. Of course there are disadvantaged families that have fallen on bad times mixed in and the countless others but we\u2019ve acknowledged that we\u2019ve a large mental health problem but have made no provision for them before a crisis ensues. It\u2019s Catch and Release and Repeat until there\u2019s enough to warrant intervention. That\u2019s the sad part, we know they need treatment, we just don\u2019t know how to provide it."

                "This was 100% preventable, and a result of police and emergency response failures. The killer\u2019s family had made TWO separate 911 calls less than 24 hours before the attack, begging him to be institutionalized or even just taken to a hospital for a psychiatric hold. Vancouver Police determined it was \u201cunnecessary\u201d and \u201cnot a mental health emergency\u201d and did not take him for evaluation by an actual psychiatric professional. Had he been taken to hospital as his family repeatedly begged for, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to do this. \n\nHis brother, a gay makeup artist, was murdered last year. His mother attempted suicide months later, and he absolutely spiralled and had dozens of mental health crises. If they had gotten the care required or if we had actual residential mental health facilities (the ones previous provincial governments closed down to \u201csave taxpayer money\u201d 20 years ago\u2026) we could have had 11 people still alive today. \n\nThinking about how this guy\u2019s family loss 15 months ago led to this, and how we need to make sure the survivors and their families from this killing are not abandoned in the same way and get adequate mental care\n\nOur douchebag wannabe fratboy mayor Ken Sim campaigned on a promise to hire \u201c100 more cops and 100 more mental health nurses\u201d and then proceeded to completely renege on the second, and the 100 cops he hired apparently thought they could do the work of a psychiatrist and decide guys like this didn\u2019t actually need hospital assessment\u2026.",

                "What\u2019s especially sad is that there\u2019s an excellent chance that the perpetrator of the attack will be sentenced to a mental health facility. James Brady died from wounds sustained when Ronald Reagan was shot by John Hinckley Jr.  He was judged innocent by reason of insanity and eventually released from the institution. That\u2019s the especially troubling thing is that the punishment of the crime is not commiserate with the tragedy inflicted on the innocent victims. **Yet we as rational people are unable to punish the mentally unstable.** So the greatest tragedy in Vancouvers history may have an inadequate closure for everyone.\n\nEdit: When Ronald Reagan was Governor of California the Supreme Court said that we couldn\u2019t institutionalize the Mentally Ill without their consent or a Court order. So as a result Mental Institutions were closed and the Mentally Unstable released. However there was no provision for them to get out patient care or to receive housing assistance or any of the myriad services needed to be on their own. Thus began the large homeless population we have. Of course there are disadvantaged families that have fallen on bad times mixed in and the countless others but we\u2019ve acknowledged that we\u2019ve a large mental health problem but have made no provision for them before a crisis ensues. It\u2019s Catch and Release and Repeat until there\u2019s enough to warrant intervention. That\u2019s the sad part, we know they need treatment, we just don\u2019t know how to provide it."
