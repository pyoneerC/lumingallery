                "Anyone want to guess where a Cleveland Cliffs plant is that could really fuck over a lot of Trump voters? Middletown, Ohio, childhood home of JD Vance. The same plant that his beloved grandpa worked and earned a pension from that paid to raise him.\n\n\nIf that plant shuts down even for a bit I can't wait for the bitching and moaning from the people that voted for those two assholes to begin and the Olympic level gymnastics as they try to assign blame to anyone but them.",

I\u2019m sure the two thousand workers being laid off will just call up their mortgage companies and let them know once trumps policies really take effect they will resume payment on the mortgage. Surely their lender will understand and let them live for free until whenever the fuck this fantasy might play out.",
                "I\u2019ve written hundreds of company press releases and can attest that we go to great measures to wordsmith these things, and spend days crafting them while hanging on the impact of individual words and how they\u2019ll be received by investors, analysts and the Street at large. We prep responses to potential inbound questions and go overboard in every sense of the word. \n\nThe phrase *insufficient demand and pricing* is the key here. The Investor Relations and Comms team burned days coming up with something sufficient to relay to the Street and\u2026shat the bed. Absolutely anyone paying attention that matters knows what these words mean. The follow up question to *our company is experiencing simultaneous *declining demand and increasing costs* is \u201cwhat are the primary catalysts causing your declining demand and increased costs?\u201d If management says something akin to *definitely not the tariffs* they\u2019ll get laughed out of their jobs. \n\nLet\u2019s see how the stock reacts tomorrow morning. The company\u2019s earnings call is on May 8th, where they are surely going to get questioned and pressed on the economic backdrop impacting the company.\n\nAlso, in a separate release the company said in March that it will idle a steel plant in Dearborn, Mich., affecting about 600 workers, citing \u201cweak automotive production in the United States.\"\n\n\u201cWe believe that, once President Trump\u2019s policies take full effect and automotive production is re-shored, we should be able to resume steel production at Dearborn,\u201d it said.\n\nThose 600 workers will likely get their jobs back in about 5-7 years, or perhaps longer.\n\n*edit\n\nI found some numbers. This isn\u2019t scientific or even rigorous, but apparently ford reshored the production of the F-650 some years ago. It took about a year to get the plant going and the company sold 17,000 units that production year. That represents less than 1% of 2024 total unit sales. Good luck everyone.",

This isn\u2019t scientific or even rigorous, but apparently ford reshored the production of the F-650 some years ago.

Not one doctor believed me they all said I was drug seeking and told me to go to rehab.  I got to the point the pain was so bad that I would pass out from going from a laying to a sitting position.  My 5th visit to emerg a doctor finally believed me.  I was admitted to hospital for 8 months, had to be on a picc line for 18 months with constant infusion of antibiotics.  Because I was not treated for 6 weeks the infection had gotten so bad it went from the surgical site at l4 all the way to my c7.  I could no longer walk and had to use a wheelchair for 2 years.  I had to have 80 k in renos to my house to accomodate a wheelchair.  It took me 2 years to go back to work and 10 years to be out of the wheelchair.

You assumed it was something else due to my age, gave up, and it cost me 6 critical months. I'm only here seeing you because my insurance required it.\"\n\nHe was a little shocked by that response too."
