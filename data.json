We prep responses to potential inbound questions and go overboard in every sense of the word. \n\nThe phrase *insufficient demand and pricing* is the key here. The Investor Relations and Comms team burned days coming up with something sufficient to relay to the Street and\u2026shat the bed. Absolutely anyone paying attention that matters knows what these words mean. The follow up question to *our company is experiencing simultaneous *declining demand and increasing costs* is \u201cwhat are the primary catalysts causing your declining demand and increased costs?\u201d If management says something akin to *definitely not the tariffs* they\u2019ll get laughed out of their jobs. \n\nLet\u2019s see how the stock reacts tomorrow morning. The company\u2019s earnings call is on May 8th, where they are surely going to get questioned and pressed on the economic backdrop impacting the company.\n\nAlso, in a separate release the company said in March that it will idle a steel plant in Dearborn, Mich., affecting about 600 workers, citing \u201cweak automotive production in the United States.\"\n\n\u201cWe believe that, once President Trump\u2019s policies take full effect and automotive production is re-shored, we should be able to resume steel production at Dearborn,\u201d it said.\n\nThose 600 workers will likely get their jobs back in about 5-7 years, or perhaps longer.",
