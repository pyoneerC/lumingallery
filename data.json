This will one way or another cause things to come to a head.\n\nThis administration has pushed and pushed, however I think their card blanche is wearing off, and they know it. As the walked back tariffs on most of the world, and backed down from confrontations with Harvard and other Universities. Behind the scenes there is push back from the wealthy who ordered one brand of order, and got another.\n\nThey were pushing to get certain things done, and now their unified front of support is seeing cracks.\n\nI am not saying what will happen, I am saying this is pushing the line very far for some of their constitutionalist supporters and companies, that depend on the rule of law to be upheld at least at the supreme court level, even if it is bad law.",

(Try it now so you see how it works before you need it. You can cancel out of the power off screen.)\n\nPolice will ask for your passcode so they can fish for evidence of illegal activity, snoop around your private photos and posts, get a list of your friends on social media, install stuff on your phone, or make a copy of its contents. Just like nothing you say to a cop will talk him out of arresting you, giving a cop your phone's passcode isn't going to let him look through your phone and then decide to release you.",

That feels like a different lifetime.\n\nI think my next trip back to Canada will be in the air. I'm just about done with land borders. It used to be it was an after thought to pass through a land border.  Not anymore. I completely empathize with anyone who isn't white crossing the border these days. I mean I'm nervous myself. I can't even imagine how scared they must be.\n\nAll of this is so ridiculous. I didn't vote for Trump and I knew it would be a shit show if he got elected.
