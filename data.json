Against orders of a legal settlement that gave him protection. To be placed in CECOT, but the only detailed claim against him is he had cocaine.

Cerna added that Immigration and Customs Enforcement determined Cristian was subject to removal following the invocation of the AEA.\n\nSo he was deported to El Salvador when he was from Venezuela. Against orders of a legal settlement that gave him protection. To be placed in CECOT, but the only detailed claim against him is he had cocaine. Are we going to be arresting every college kid who does cocaine and tossing them in a US Supermax without due process?
