                "#Alabama Woman Charged with Attempted Murder After Deputy Shot in Shocking Confrontation\n\nA routine call to investigate a theft in Elmore County, Alabama, took a dramatic and violent turn when a woman allegedly pulled a gun and shot a deputy, landing herself behind bars on attempted murder charges.\n\nThe suspect, 40-year-old Ebony Bracy from Wetumpka, had initially been speaking with officers when the situation escalated. According to Sheriff Bill Franklin, she was reportedly incoherent when deputies arrived at the scene on Dozier Road in the Redland community. As officers conducted their investigation, they discovered Bracy had outstanding warrants, though details of these were not immediately disclosed.\n\nWhen they attempted to take her into custody, she allegedly drew a firearm and opened fire, hitting one deputy in the forearm. The bullet travelled up to his bicep, wounding him. In the chaos that followed, another deputy fired back, striking Bracy in the upper torso. Though the extent of her injury was not fully detailed, the sheriff suggested she would likely need stitches. A second woman, who had been standing behind Bracy, was also caught in the crossfire, taking a bullet to the thigh.\n\nBracy is now being held at the Elmore County Jail with bail set at a staggering $2 million. The state has launched an investigation into the incident, though officials have yet to release further details.\n\nWhat started as a theft report ended with gunfire, injuries and serious charges, leaving the community rattled and authorities determined to piece together exactly what led to the shocking turn of events.",

The normal crew mission to the ISS lasts 6 months and there have been people who have stayed for over a year.
