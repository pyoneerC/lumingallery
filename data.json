Husband was the last to travel alone after closing up the old house. He was driving through a mountainous area and veered off the road. His car landed in a very wooded area many feet below the highway and not visible. He was pinned hanging upside down and could not get down or out of the car. Couldn\u2019t reach the phone and the battery eventually died. Authorities were reluctant to do deep search because he had not been missing 24 hours. They said he could have stopped off to eat or rest. She reached out to friends and family and anyone who would help. They were able to narrow down the search area on the basis of his last conversation with his wife. The only reason they finally found him was a bright red dolly fell out of his truck during the accident and the handle was sticking out of a visible area. This is why you should always let someone know of your travel plans and check in once in a while and keep your phone charged.",
