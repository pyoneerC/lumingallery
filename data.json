                ">An Idaho teacher is in a standoff with her own school district after officials ordered her to remove classroom signs, including one that reads, \u201cEveryone is welcome here.\u201d\u00a0\n\n>Sarah Inama, a sixth-grade history teacher at Lewis and Clark Middle School in Meridian, Idaho, says she won\u2019t comply with the order, arguing that the message is a fundamental part to ensuring a positive learning environment for her students.\n\n>Inama, who has taught at the school for five years, says her commitment to inclusivity isn\u2019t about politics. It\u2019s about her passion for education and students.\n\n>\u201cI love the area that I teach,\u201d she says in an interview with TODAY.com. \u201cIt\u2019s really a valuable thing for people to know our human history, things that humans have accomplished, our time on this earth, things that they\u2019ve overcome, patterns that exist.\u201d\n\n>Five years ago, when she first put up the two signs, it was to make sure students knew they were in an open and welcoming space.\u00a0Now, she says she is risking her job in the name of those values.\n\n>Inama says the controversy began in January when her principal and vice principal came to her classroom to inform her that two posters on her walls were controversial and needed to be removed, a detail the district verified in an email to TODAY.com. Inama says other teachers were given similar instruction, but she was caught off guard by the directive.\n\nGood for her for refusing to back down from the \"controversial\" view that *Everyone is welcome here.*",
                "Her decorations seem pretty benign and somewhat \u201ccontent-neutral\u201d\n\nI guess it\u2019s now controversial and innapropriate to state that all people are equal? Administration should clearly define why the given decoration goes against their policy in detail\u2026",

                "They're acting like this a big deal, but letting her stay the rest of the school year - they know they're wrong and they just need a teacher in that classroom.

The teacher's sign only echoes their official policy of inclusion and respect, so either they're lying (they don't actually believe everyone deserves respect and/or inclusion), or they're just suppressing individual speech. There's zero wiggle room here.\n\n\nMy opinion? My guess is they're lying. We know very well that Jim Crow, segregation, and the KKK were the official responses to emancipation. They were legislated into the closet, forced to use dog whistles. Now they're getting comfy and coming back out.\n\n\n\"Red and yellow, black and white, they are precious in his sight.

                "#Vanishing History: Arlington Cemetery Erases Stories of Black and Female Veterans\n\nSomething strange is happening at Arlington National Cemetery. The sprawling burial ground, where hundreds of thousands of American veterans rest, has quietly erased large chunks of its history from public view. Information about black, Hispanic and female service members, once readily available on its website, has vanished. The pages once told the stories of men and women who broke barriers and gave their all for a country that did not always give back. Now, with a few clicks, they are simply gone.\n\nThe move is part of President Donald Trump's sweeping effort to rid the US military and federal government of diversity, equity and inclusion policies. His administration has been swift in shutting down initiatives that highlight the contributions of minority groups, and Arlington has not been spared.\n\nVisitors looking for details about notable graves have run into dead ends. The pages once dedicated to figures such as General Colin Powell, the first black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the legendary Tuskegee Airmen, the country's first black military pilots, have disappeared. The same goes for Hector Santa Anna, a World War II hero and decorated bomber pilot. Even broader categories of history have been stripped away. Sections on African American, Hispanic and Women's history are no longer easily accessible from the main site.\n\nOfficially, Arlington insists it is working to restore some of the missing content, though it also says it wants to ensure everything aligns with Trump's executive orders and the policies of Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth. Hegseth, a former Fox News host and military veteran, has been vocal about his desire to root out what he calls \u201cwoke\u201d culture from the armed forces. He was instrumental in removing General CQ Brown, the first black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who had supported diversity efforts.\n\nThe backlash has already begun. Representative Adam Smith, a senior Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, called the situation \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and suggested there was never a problem with diversity in the military to begin with. Earlier this year, a similar attempt to remove training materials on the Tuskegee Airmen sparked national outrage, forcing the Pentagon to reverse course.\n\nThe US military today is a complex institution, with more than two million people serving in active duty or reserves. A significant portion of them come from minority backgrounds. Thirty per cent identify as black, Native American or other underrepresented groups, while nearly one-fifth are women. The stories now missing from Arlington's website belong to people who paved the way for them.\n\nHistory cannot be deleted as easily as a webpage. The soldiers buried at Arlington, no matter their background, are not just names etched into headstones. They were real people who lived, fought and sacrificed. Whether or not their stories remain in an online archive, their contributions cannot be erased. But the question remains, why is their history being buried once again?",
                "Just like bigoted American Jesus intended.",
                "They are LITERALLY erasing women and black people from history and from social awareness.\n\nHow the ever-loving fuck is this even remotely acceptable? Why are millions of citizens not marching on Washington to lay siege to the city and demanding for this to stop?\n\nI don\u2019t think I understand this world anymore.",
                "Man all the people who bitched and moaned about feminism and how the west isnt sexist is gonna have to explain the complete censoring and deletion of women in history."

I was correct, but the article really didn't mention that. \n\nHere's the technology they used. \n\n\n\"Lyfgenia is a personalized gene therapy that uses the patient's own blood-forming stem cells. These cells are modified in the laboratory to contain a healthy copy of the beta-globin gene, which is responsible for producing sickle hemoglobin. The modified cells are then infused back into the patient, where they establish themselves in the bone marrow and produce healthy hemoglobin. This helps to reduce or eliminate the production of sickle hemoglobin, which is the underlying cause of SCD.\"",

                "#Vanishing History: Arlington Cemetery Erases Stories of Black and Female Veterans\n\nSomething strange is happening at Arlington National Cemetery. The sprawling burial ground, where hundreds of thousands of American veterans rest, has quietly erased large chunks of its history from public view. Information about black, Hispanic and female service members, once readily available on its website, has vanished. The pages once told the stories of men and women who broke barriers and gave their all for a country that did not always give back. Now, with a few clicks, they are simply gone.\n\nThe move is part of President Donald Trump's sweeping effort to rid the US military and federal government of diversity, equity and inclusion policies. His administration has been swift in shutting down initiatives that highlight the contributions of minority groups, and Arlington has not been spared.\n\nVisitors looking for details about notable graves have run into dead ends. The pages once dedicated to figures such as General Colin Powell, the first black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the legendary Tuskegee Airmen, the country's first black military pilots, have disappeared. The same goes for Hector Santa Anna, a World War II hero and decorated bomber pilot. Even broader categories of history have been stripped away. Sections on African American, Hispanic and Women's history are no longer easily accessible from the main site.\n\nOfficially, Arlington insists it is working to restore some of the missing content, though it also says it wants to ensure everything aligns with Trump's executive orders and the policies of Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth. Hegseth, a former Fox News host and military veteran, has been vocal about his desire to root out what he calls \u201cwoke\u201d culture from the armed forces. He was instrumental in removing General CQ Brown, the first black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who had supported diversity efforts.\n\nThe backlash has already begun. Representative Adam Smith, a senior Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, called the situation \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and suggested there was never a problem with diversity in the military to begin with. Earlier this year, a similar attempt to remove training materials on the Tuskegee Airmen sparked national outrage, forcing the Pentagon to reverse course.\n\nThe US military today is a complex institution, with more than two million people serving in active duty or reserves. A significant portion of them come from minority backgrounds. Thirty per cent identify as black, Native American or other underrepresented groups, while nearly one-fifth are women. The stories now missing from Arlington's website belong to people who paved the way for them.\n\nHistory cannot be deleted as easily as a webpage. The soldiers buried at Arlington, no matter their background, are not just names etched into headstones. They were real people who lived, fought and sacrificed. Whether or not their stories remain in an online archive, their contributions cannot be erased. But the question remains, why is their history being buried once again?",
                "Just like bigoted American Jesus intended.",
                "They are LITERALLY erasing women and black people from history and from social awareness.\n\nHow the ever-loving fuck is this even remotely acceptable? Why are millions of citizens not marching on Washington to lay siege to the city and demanding for this to stop?\n\nI don\u2019t think I understand this world anymore.",
                "Man all the people who bitched and moaned about feminism and how the west isnt sexist is gonna have to explain the complete censoring and deletion of women in history."

The modified cells are then infused back into the patient, where they establish themselves in the bone marrow and produce healthy hemoglobin. This helps to reduce or eliminate the production of sickle hemoglobin, which is the underlying cause of SCD.\"",

                "#Vanishing History: Arlington Cemetery Erases Stories of Black and Female Veterans\n\nSomething strange is happening at Arlington National Cemetery. The sprawling burial ground, where hundreds of thousands of American veterans rest, has quietly erased large chunks of its history from public view. Information about black, Hispanic and female service members, once readily available on its website, has vanished. The pages once told the stories of men and women who broke barriers and gave their all for a country that did not always give back. Now, with a few clicks, they are simply gone.\n\nThe move is part of President Donald Trump's sweeping effort to rid the US military and federal government of diversity, equity and inclusion policies. His administration has been swift in shutting down initiatives that highlight the contributions of minority groups, and Arlington has not been spared.\n\nVisitors looking for details about notable graves have run into dead ends. The pages once dedicated to figures such as General Colin Powell, the first black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the legendary Tuskegee Airmen, the country's first black military pilots, have disappeared. The same goes for Hector Santa Anna, a World War II hero and decorated bomber pilot. Even broader categories of history have been stripped away. Sections on African American, Hispanic and Women's history are no longer easily accessible from the main site.\n\nOfficially, Arlington insists it is working to restore some of the missing content, though it also says it wants to ensure everything aligns with Trump's executive orders and the policies of Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth. Hegseth, a former Fox News host and military veteran, has been vocal about his desire to root out what he calls \u201cwoke\u201d culture from the armed forces. He was instrumental in removing General CQ Brown, the first black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who had supported diversity efforts.\n\nThe backlash has already begun. Representative Adam Smith, a senior Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, called the situation \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and suggested there was never a problem with diversity in the military to begin with. Earlier this year, a similar attempt to remove training materials on the Tuskegee Airmen sparked national outrage, forcing the Pentagon to reverse course.\n\nThe US military today is a complex institution, with more than two million people serving in active duty or reserves. A significant portion of them come from minority backgrounds. Thirty per cent identify as black, Native American or other underrepresented groups, while nearly one-fifth are women. The stories now missing from Arlington's website belong to people who paved the way for them.\n\nHistory cannot be deleted as easily as a webpage. The soldiers buried at Arlington, no matter their background, are not just names etched into headstones. They were real people who lived, fought and sacrificed. Whether or not their stories remain in an online archive, their contributions cannot be erased. But the question remains, why is their history being buried once again?",
                "Just like bigoted American Jesus intended.",
                "They are LITERALLY erasing women and black people from history and from social awareness.\n\nHow the ever-loving fuck is this even remotely acceptable? Why are millions of citizens not marching on Washington to lay siege to the city and demanding for this to stop?\n\nI don\u2019t think I understand this world anymore.",
                "Man all the people who bitched and moaned about feminism and how the west isnt sexist is gonna have to explain the complete censoring and deletion of women in history."

It\u2019s about her passion for education and students.\n\n>\u201cI love the area that I teach,\u201d she says in an interview with TODAY.com. \u201cIt\u2019s really a valuable thing for people to know our human history, things that humans have accomplished, our time on this earth, things that they\u2019ve overcome, patterns that exist.\u201d\n\n>Five years ago, when she first put up the two signs, it was to make sure students knew they were in an open and welcoming space.\u00a0Now, she says she is risking her job in the name of those values.\n\n>Inama says the controversy began in January when her principal and vice principal came to her classroom to inform her that two posters on her walls were controversial and needed to be removed, a detail the district verified in an email to TODAY.com. Inama says other teachers were given similar instruction, but she was caught off guard by the directive.\n\nGood for her for refusing to back down from the \"controversial\" view that *Everyone is welcome here.*",
