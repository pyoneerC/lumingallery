The agent must have a judicial warrant to do this, and your attorney will advise you on what areas are covered by a warrant.\n\n* A judicial warrant is different from an administrative warrant, the latter of which is issued by ICE itself.\n\n* There is dispute over whether the ICE agents who arrived on April 18 had a warrant. This is semantic obfuscation regarding the difference between judicial and administrative warrants.\n\n* This situation is following recent activity in Milwaukee, in which Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents entered the hallways of the Milwaukee County Courthouse to arrest two individuals on March 20 and April 3. \n\n* More generally, the federal government is escalating efforts to compel local officials to assist in immigration enforcement efforts. Specifically memos issued in January 2025 state that\n\nhttps://www.ice.gov/about-ice/ero/protected-areas\n\n> ICE officers or agents may conduct civil immigration enforcement actions in or near courthouses when they have credible information that leads them to believe the targeted alien(s) is or will be present at a specific location, and where such action is not precluded by laws imposed by the jurisdiction in which the civil immigration enforcement action will take place.\n\n* This is bad policy because immigrants who enter the courthouse might be there to access vital government services, or as a victim or witness to a crime. Any policy that prevents people from participating in the judicial system undermines due process.\n\n* The fight over Judge Dugan's incarceration is a fight over this policy.",

                "*Article Text:*\n\nLONDON \u2014 A lettercard penned by one of the Titanic\u2019s most well-known survivors from onboard the ship, days before it sank, has sold for 300,000 pounds ($399,000) at auction.\n\nIn the note, written to the seller\u2019s great-uncle on April 10, 1912, first-class passenger Archibald Gracie wrote of the ill-fated steamship: \u201cIt is a fine ship but I shall await my journeys end before I pass judgment on her.\u201d\n\nThe letter was sold to a private collector from the United States on Saturday, according to auction house Henry Aldridge & Son in Wiltshire, England. The hammer price far exceeded the initial estimate price of 60,000 pounds.\n\nThe letter is believed to be the sole example in existence from Gracie from onboard the Titanic, which sank off Newfoundland after hitting an iceberg, killing about 1,500 people on its maiden voyage.\n\nAuctioneer Andrew Aldridge described it as an \u201cexceptional museum grade piece.\u201d\n\nGracie, who jumped from the ship and managed to scramble onto an overturned collapsible boat, was rescued by other passengers onboard a lifeboat and was taken to the R.M.S. Carpathia. He went on to write \u201cThe Truth about the Titanic,\u201d an account of his experiences, when he returned to New York City.\n\nGracie boarded the Titanic in Southampton on April 10, 1912, and was assigned first-class cabin C51. His book is seen as one of the most detailed accounts of the events of the night the ship sank, Aldridge said. Gracie did not fully recover from the hypothermia he suffered, and died of complications from diabetes in late 1912.\n\nThe letter was postmarked Queenstown, Ireland, one of two stops the Titanic made before sinking.",

The agent must have a judicial warrant to do this, and your attorney will advise you on what areas are covered by a warrant.\n\n* A judicial warrant is different from an administrative warrant, the latter of which is issued by ICE itself.\n\n* There is dispute over whether the ICE agents who arrived on April 18 had a warrant. This is semantic obfuscation regarding the difference between judicial and administrative warrants.\n\n* This situation is following recent activity in Milwaukee, in which Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents entered the hallways of the Milwaukee County Courthouse to arrest two individuals on March 20 and April 3. \n\n* More generally, the federal government is escalating efforts to compel local officials to assist in immigration enforcement efforts. Specifically memos issued in January 2025 state that\n\nhttps://www.ice.gov/about-ice/ero/protected-areas\n\n> ICE officers or agents may conduct civil immigration enforcement actions in or near courthouses when they have credible information that leads them to believe the targeted alien(s) is or will be present at a specific location, and where such action is not precluded by laws imposed by the jurisdiction in which the civil immigration enforcement action will take place.\n\n* This is bad policy because immigrants who enter the courthouse might be there to access vital government services, or as a victim or witness to a crime. Any policy that prevents people from participating in the judicial system undermines due process.\n\n* The fight over Judge Dugan's incarceration is a fight over this policy.",

The hammer price far exceeded the initial estimate price of 60,000 pounds.\n\nThe letter is believed to be the sole example in existence from Gracie from onboard the Titanic, which sank off Newfoundland after hitting an iceberg, killing about 1,500 people on its maiden voyage.\n\nAuctioneer Andrew Aldridge described it as an \u201cexceptional museum grade piece.\u201d\n\nGracie, who jumped from the ship and managed to scramble onto an overturned collapsible boat, was rescued by other passengers onboard a lifeboat and was taken to the R.M.S. Carpathia. He went on to write \u201cThe Truth about the Titanic,\u201d an account of his experiences, when he returned to New York City.\n\nGracie boarded the Titanic in Southampton on April 10, 1912, and was assigned first-class cabin C51. His book is seen as one of the most detailed accounts of the events of the night the ship sank, Aldridge said. Gracie did not fully recover from the hypothermia he suffered, and died of complications from diabetes in late 1912.\n\nThe letter was postmarked Queenstown, Ireland, one of two stops the Titanic made before sinking.",

The agent must have a judicial warrant to do this, and your attorney will advise you on what areas are covered by a warrant.\n\n* A judicial warrant is different from an administrative warrant, the latter of which is issued by ICE itself.\n\n* There is dispute over whether the ICE agents who arrived on April 18 had a warrant. This is semantic obfuscation regarding the difference between judicial and administrative warrants.\n\n* This situation is following recent activity in Milwaukee, in which Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents entered the hallways of the Milwaukee County Courthouse to arrest two individuals on March 20 and April 3. \n\n* More generally, the federal government is escalating efforts to compel local officials to assist in immigration enforcement efforts. Specifically memos issued in January 2025 state that\n\nhttps://www.ice.gov/about-ice/ero/protected-areas\n\n> ICE officers or agents may conduct civil immigration enforcement actions in or near courthouses when they have credible information that leads them to believe the targeted alien(s) is or will be present at a specific location, and where such action is not precluded by laws imposed by the jurisdiction in which the civil immigration enforcement action will take place.\n\n* This is bad policy because immigrants who enter the courthouse might be there to access vital government services, or as a victim or witness to a crime. Any policy that prevents people from participating in the judicial system undermines due process.\n\n* The fight over Judge Dugan's incarceration is a fight over this policy.",

The hammer price far exceeded the initial estimate price of 60,000 pounds.\n\nThe letter is believed to be the sole example in existence from Gracie from onboard the Titanic, which sank off Newfoundland after hitting an iceberg, killing about 1,500 people on its maiden voyage.\n\nAuctioneer Andrew Aldridge described it as an \u201cexceptional museum grade piece.\u201d\n\nGracie, who jumped from the ship and managed to scramble onto an overturned collapsible boat, was rescued by other passengers onboard a lifeboat and was taken to the R.M.S. Carpathia. He went on to write \u201cThe Truth about the Titanic,\u201d an account of his experiences, when he returned to New York City.\n\nGracie boarded the Titanic in Southampton on April 10, 1912, and was assigned first-class cabin C51. His book is seen as one of the most detailed accounts of the events of the night the ship sank, Aldridge said. Gracie did not fully recover from the hypothermia he suffered, and died of complications from diabetes in late 1912.\n\nThe letter was postmarked Queenstown, Ireland, one of two stops the Titanic made before sinking.",
