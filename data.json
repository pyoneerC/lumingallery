He also agreed to restitution and forfeiture totaling nearly $580,000.",

                "George Santos is, hands down, the best minor villain America has ever seen. His story is absolutely wild. And not merely because he has a drag-queen alter ego, [Kitara Rivache](https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/george-santos-says-will-revive-drag-queen-persona-cameo-rcna149867).\n\nThe Republican party is an organized crime syndicate. Like the mob, [the GOP happily protected Santos from expulsion](https://apnews.com/article/george-santos-expel-house-republicans-new-york-249bd2341d157bc6727b77607d8d45ae) when he merely deceived voters with financial fraud.\n\nBut, Santos broke the most important rule in organized crime: don't steal from the mob. [Santos sent emails to Senator Kevin McCarthy's wealthy donors claiming to be McCarthy's fundraiser. Santos siphoned money from McCarthy's campaign into his own](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/09/george-santos-raised-money-from-wealthy-gop-donors-while-lying-about-his-resume.html).\n\nThat was the last straw.

This dude was an absolute nobody before coming into the picture and deeply embarrassed a lot of really powerful people. I could be mistaken but I don\u2019t think a single republican has spoken up in defense of Santos with any meaningful weight beyond maybe a broad platitude about democrats being worse or something. If he didn\u2019t plead guilty they would have 100% thrown the book at him.",
