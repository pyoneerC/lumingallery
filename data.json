Can you keep a secret?' worked for me,\" and, \"Because my wife is away on a trip.\" The prefectural police believe that the men continued to sexually abuse their own daughters and others on a regular basis.\n\nIn November last year, one of the men was arrested on suspicion of penetrative sexual assault of an underage person, and a probe of his mobile phone revealed that the group was sharing obscene videos.\n\nIt is thought that the group, comprised of men fond of incest with minors, started exchanging information in around December 2023.

                "Why was the kid in a hyperbaric chamber??",
                "Four people have been arrested after a 5-year-old boy was killed in a hyperbaric chamber explosion in Troy, Michigan.\n\nThe Troy Police Department confirmed that the arrests occurred Monday morning. They are scheduled to be arraigned on Tuesday.\n\nPolice did not release the names of the people arrested; however, court records show that one of them was Tami Peterson, the center's owner. \n\nCBS News Detroit reached out to the Oxford Center for comment and received the following statement: \n\n    \"After cooperating with multiple investigations starting immediately after the tragic accident in January, we are disappointed to see charges filed.\n\n    \"The timing of these charges is surprising, as the typical protocol after a fire-related accident has not yet been completed. There are still outstanding questions about how this occurred. Yet, the Attorney General's office proceeded to pursue charges without those answers.\n\n    \"Our highest priority every day is the safety and wellbeing of the children and families we serve, which continues during this process.\"\n\nInvestigators say Thomas Cooper was in the chamber when it exploded on Jan. 31, 2025. The boy's mother was in the room at the time and was injured in the explosion. In a news conference shortly after the incident, Troy police and fire departments did not indicate what may have led to the explosion but said that hyperbaric chambers are filled with 100% oxygen and are, therefore, combustible devices.\n\nWithin days of the tragedy, the family retained Fieger Law, which alleges that the center had a history of being involved in questionable business practices.\n\nAttorney James Harrington told CBS News Detroit last month that his office was getting ready to file a lawsuit demanding answers into what led to his death. Harrington said the lawsuit will be filed pending their investigation.\n\n\"Under no circumstances ... should anything ever like this happen and the only way this happens is negligence,\" Harrington said. \"This industry in Michigan is unregulated. There's not a lot of science to back these claims that are being made as to what ailments and problems can actually be fixed or better by this hyperbaric treatment.\"",
                "Ethics aside, these chambers are usually very safe to use for their intended purpose (oxygen delivery is part of it) so I wonder what made this one fail.",
                "Maybe more confused after reading the article than I was by the headline.\n\nDefendants are disappointed charges were filed this quickly because normal fire accident protocol hadn't run its course?\n\nNo insight as to why the kid was in a hyperbaric chamber in what was described as an unregulated industry?\n\nSeems like a very bizarre situation that resulted in the unnecessary death of a child.",
                "This was the core plot in the novel Miracle Creek by Angie Kim.",
                "They were trying to \"cure\" his ND disorders (ADHD and I think something else).\u00a0\n\n\nIt's rich that their attorney is saying there's no science behind this and it should be better regulated.\n\n\nNo. It should be banned outright. And also, I don't think the parents are blameless. Take your kid to a fucking doctor. I know these places are predatory but take your kid to a fucking doctor.\u00a0\n\n\nMy kid has ADHD and is the same age as this kid, and we live not too far from there. Breaks my heart.\u00a0",
                "As a hyperbaric technician, this could've been prevented easily by doing simple maintenance from the chambers manufacturer but also the proper safety checklist before starting the treatment. Gross negligence for sure, last time something like this happened in the states was 2009 with gross negligence and lack of chamber certification...such a shame, poor kid never had a chance.",
                "I'm a little confused by this;  The CEO of the center is being charged with second degree murder but the technician that operated the chamber is only being charged with manslaughter.  I'm confused why the guy that was most likely ACTUALLY responsible for the death is being given lighter charges than the person who owns the company.",

Can you keep a secret?' worked for me,\" and, \"Because my wife is away on a trip.\" The prefectural police believe that the men continued to sexually abuse their own daughters and others on a regular basis.\n\nIn November last year, one of the men was arrested on suspicion of penetrative sexual assault of an underage person, and a probe of his mobile phone revealed that the group was sharing obscene videos.\n\nIt is thought that the group, comprised of men fond of incest with minors, started exchanging information in around December 2023.

                "If anybody is wondering why Trump would engage in such absurd \"negotiation\" tactics, it can be traced to his history and pathology.  Here's a professor whose specialty is negotiations discussing in-a-nutshell why Trump's tactics are incredibly foolish:\n\n----\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to get a little wonky and write about Donald Trump and negotiations. For those who don't know, I'm an adjunct professor at Indiana University - Robert H. McKinney School of Law and I teach negotiations. Okay, here goes.\n\nTrump, as most of us know, is the credited author of \"The Art of the Deal,\" a book that was actually ghost written by a man named Tony Schwartz, who was given access to Trump and wrote based upon his observations. If you've read The Art of the Deal, or if you've followed Trump lately, you'll know, even if you didn't know the label, that he sees all dealmaking as what we call \"distributive bargaining.\"\n\nDistributive bargaining always has a winner and a loser. It happens when there is a fixed quantity of something and two sides are fighting over how it gets distributed. Think of it as a pie and you're fighting over who gets how many pieces. In Trump's world, the bargaining was for a building, or for construction work, or subcontractors. He perceives a successful bargain as one in which there is a winner and a loser, so if he pays less than the seller wants, he wins. The more he saves the more he wins.\n\nThe other type of bargaining is called integrative bargaining. In integrative bargaining the two sides don't have a complete conflict of interest, and it is possible to reach mutually beneficial agreements. Think of it, not a single pie to be divided by two hungry people, but as a baker and a caterer negotiating over how many pies will be baked at what prices, and the nature of their ongoing relationship after this one gig is over.\n\nThe problem with Trump is that he sees only distributive bargaining in an international world that requires integrative bargaining. He can raise tariffs, but so can other countries. He can't demand they not respond. There is no defined end to the negotiation and there is no simple winner and loser. There are always more pies to be baked. Further, negotiations aren't binary. China's choices aren't (a) buy soybeans from US farmers, or (b) don't buy soybeans. They can also (c) buy soybeans from Russia, or Argentina, or Brazil, or Canada, etc. That completely strips the distributive bargainer of his power to win or lose, to control the negotiation.\n\nOne of the risks of distributive bargaining is bad will. In a one-time distributive bargain, e.g. negotiating with the cabinet maker in your casino about whether you're going to pay his whole bill or demand a discount, you don't have to worry about your ongoing credibility or the next deal. If you do that to the cabinet maker, you can bet he won't agree to do the cabinets in your next casino, and you're going to have to find another cabinet maker.\n\nThere isn't another Canada.\n\nSo when you approach international negotiation, in a world as complex as ours, with integrated economies and multiple buyers and sellers, you simply must approach them through integrative bargaining. If you attempt distributive bargaining, success is impossible. And we see that already.\n\nTrump has raised tariffs on China. China responded, in addition to raising tariffs on US goods, by dropping all its soybean orders from the US and buying them from Russia. The effect is not only to cause tremendous harm to US farmers, but also to increase Russian revenue, making Russia less susceptible to sanctions and boycotts, increasing its economic and political power in the world, and reducing ours. Trump saw steel and aluminum and thought it would be an easy win, BECAUSE HE SAW ONLY STEEL AND ALUMINUM - HE SEES EVERY NEGOTIATION AS DISTRIBUTIVE. China saw it as integrative, and integrated Russia and its soybean purchase orders into a far more complex negotiation ecosystem.\n\nTrump has the same weakness politically. For every winner there must be a loser. And that's just not how politics works, not over the long run.\n\nFor people who study negotiations, this is incredibly basic stuff, negotiations 101, definitions you learn before you even start talking about styles and tactics. And here's another huge problem for us.\n\nTrump is utterly convinced that his experience in a closely held real estate company has prepared him to run a nation, and therefore he rejects the advice of people who spent entire careers studying the nuances of international negotiations and diplomacy. But the leaders on the other side of the table have not eschewed expertise, they have embraced it. And that means they look at Trump and, given his very limited tool chest and his blindly distributive understanding of negotiation, they know exactly what he is going to do and exactly how to respond to it.\n\nFrom a professional negotiation point of view, Trump isn't even bringing checkers to a chess match. He's bringing a quarter that he insists of flipping for heads or tails, while everybody else is studying the chess board to decide whether its better to open with Najdorf or Gr\u00fcnfeld.\u201d\n\n\u2014 David Honig, Robert H.
