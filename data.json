It's a powerful position, and for any cardinal electors who may be turned off by his American nationality, it's not his only one. Prevost is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Peru, where he served for many years.\n\n> Overall, **he's considered a centrist**, but on many social issues he's seen as progressive, embracing marginalized groups like Francis, who championed migrants and the poor. But Prevost opposes ordaining women as deacons, for instance, so he's seen as conservative on church doctrine.\n\n> His age could also be a factor \u2014 at 69 some may consider him too young to hold the church's highest office.",

In this case, Leo XIII was famous for issuing one of the Catholic Church's most famous edicts, ***Rerum novarum***, which criticized capitalism for its tendency toward greed, concentration of wealth, and mistreatment of workers. It strongly advocated for organizations like labor unions. At the same time, it also criticized socialism for rejecting private property and the under-emphasis of the importance of the individual.",

The teen said that they had been to a couple of homes in the neighborhood and that he was not familiar with the area.\"\n\nAt 3am? They decide it's a good idea to ring people's doorbells?

This makes Prevost a compromise candidate for Francis inspired reformers and those who want some traditional order restored.\n\n[Source](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/new-pope-conclave-cardinals-candidates-b2747161.html?callback=in&code=Y2QZN2E2NTITYTMXYI0ZZTLKLWIWY2YTOWEZN2UWOWY0NDYY&state=b0073a5d0a0d4c9d89c964618c3d2509)\n\n>While Prevost is seen overall as a centrist, on some key social issues he's viewed as progressive. He has long embraced marginalized groups, a lot like Francis, who championed migrants and the poor. But, also like Pope Francis, the Illinois native opposes ordaining women as deacons, for instance, so on that point he's seen as conservative on church doctrine\n\n[Source](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-pope-could-it-be-american-cardinal-robert-prevost/)"

                "From [CBS News last week](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/who-will-be-the-next-pope-list-of-possible-candidates/):\n\n> Chicago-born Cardinal Robert Prevost is seen as having many of the qualities desired in a pope, and if elected, he would become the first U.S. pope in the church's history.\n\n> Prevost is the head of the church's Dicastery for Bishops, meaning he oversees the selection of new bishops. It's a powerful position, and for any cardinal electors who may be turned off by his American nationality, it's not his only one. Prevost is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Peru, where he served for many years.\n\n> Overall, **he's considered a centrist**, but on many social issues he's seen as progressive, embracing marginalized groups like Francis, who championed migrants and the poor. But Prevost opposes ordaining women as deacons, for instance, so he's seen as conservative on church doctrine.\n\n> His age could also be a factor \u2014 at 69 some may consider him too young to hold the church's highest office.",

                "Papal names are often chosen for a reason or to send a message, so it's good to look at what other popes with that name did, as it can often give a hint at the new pope's views. In this case, Leo XIII was famous for issuing one of the Catholic Church's most famous edicts, ***Rerum novarum***, which criticized capitalism for its tendency toward greed, concentration of wealth, and mistreatment of workers. It strongly advocated for organizations like labor unions. At the same time, it also criticized socialism for rejecting private property and the under-emphasis of the importance of the individual.",

                "For those wondering, it's sort of a continuation of the previous Pope's idealogical leanings - champions the poor/migrants but is against ordaining women. He's also a dual US-Peru citizen."
