The deletion has hindered efforts to rescue the children and prosecute those responsible, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Yale project, funded by the US government until last month, monitored 116 sites in Russia using satellite imagery and other surveillance tools.\n\nSources suggest the deletion may have been accidental or intentional, raising potential legal risks for the Trump administration under international war crimes laws. The lost data was also being shared with the EU for its own investigations. The destruction of evidence not only affects legal cases but also complicates ongoing rescue missions.\n\nThe Yale project played a key role in gathering evidence that contributed to six ICC indictments, including against Putin and his commissioner for children\u2019s rights. Russia has been accused of forcibly transferring Ukrainian children, issuing Russian passports in occupied areas, and erasing Ukrainian identity. The loss of the secure \u201cCaesar\u201d database has been described as a violation of the Geneva Convention, which prohibits destroying war crimes evidence.
