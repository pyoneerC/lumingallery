                ">In a 7-2 decision, the\u00a0court said the Trump administration had not given the detainees enough time or adequate resources to challenge their deportations.\n\n>\u201cUnder these circumstances, notice roughly 24 hours before removal, devoid of information about how to exercise due process rights to contest that removal, surely does not pass muster,\u201d the ruling said.\n\n>The justices barred the removal of the men, who the Trump administration alleges are members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, pending a new decision from a lower federal appellate court.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that when AOC worked to give her constituents the resources needed to deny and then contest these charges she was criticized by the Trump administration's border czar Tom Homan for \"educating illegal alien criminals how to evade law enforcement\".\n\nWhy? The fact detainees only receive notice \"roughly 24 hours before removal, devoid of information about how to exercise due process rights to contest that removal\" is an intended cruelty by this administration. They don't care if you're innocent or not, they will use every trick at their disposal to secure an express deportation so that once you're gone they can claim whatever they want about you. Even in the high profile case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia when everything points to the deportee's innocence, the Trump administration is confronted and even ordered to return him to the US yet all they have to say is he'll \u201cnever live in the United States of America again\u201d and nothing is done.\n\nAs a citizen of the United States you might think you have nothing to worry about, but do you feel confident you could contest your deportation within 24 hours if they wrongfully claimed you were an illegal immigrant? Are you already familiar with the process or would you rely on Google and hope it all works out? Furthermore anyone familiar with federal offices know even the simplest of claims can be an excruciatingly slow process which begs the question, would your paperwork even reach anyone in time to contest your deportation?",
