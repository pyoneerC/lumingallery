When they were already on the boat they found their friend had forgotten a handgun in one of the bags. They reached out to my dad (an attorney) on what to do with it, he told them to throw it off the side of the boat and not bring it up to anyone. They did not and instead told staff about it. They were detained and the gun was confiscated and not returned to them or the owner and it was a big big hassle. No charges or anything though. To this day my uncle will say \u201cwe should\u2019ve just thrown it over the side.\u201d Lmao.",

The Japanese police charged him with about $3000 fine and labor costs to search the rest of his household goods by hand. Also for the cost of destroying the handgun.
