Browning argues that most of the men of \u00a0RPB 101 were not fanatical\u00a0Nazis but, rather, ordinary middle-aged, working-class men who committed these atrocities out of a mixture of motives, including the group dynamics of conformity, deference to authority, role adaptation, and the altering of moral norms to justify their actions. Very quickly three groups emerged within the battalion: a core of eager killers, a plurality who carried out their duties reliably but without initiative, and a small minority who evaded participation in the acts of killing without diminishing the murderous efficiency of the battalion whatsoever.\n\n>While this book discusses a specific Reserve Unit during WWII, the general argument Browning makes is that most people succumb to the pressures of a group setting and commit actions they would never do of their own volition. \u00a0\n\n>*Ordinary Men*\u00a0is a powerful, chilling, and important work with themes and arguments that continue to resonate today.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, Orpo must stand for Orlando Police",

                "Absolutely nuts \n\n> NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A Brooklyn woman said she feared for her life as she was chased, kicked, spit at and pelted with objects by a mob of Orthodox Jewish men who mistook her as a participant in a protest against Israel\u2019s far-right security minister.\n\n-\n\n> The woman, a neighborhood resident in her 30s, told The Associated Press she learned of the protest after hearing police helicopters over her apartment. She walked over to investigate around 10:30 p.m. but by then the protest had mostly disbursed. Not wanting to be filmed, she covered her face with a scarf.\n\n>\u201cAs soon as I pulled up my scarf, a group of 100 men came over immediately and encircled me,\u201d said the woman, who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity because she feared for her safety.\n\n>\u2018I had nowhere to go\u2019\n\n>\u201cThey were shouting at me, threatening to rape me, chanting \u2018death to Arabs.\u2019 I thought the police would protect me from the mob, but they did nothing to intervene,\u201d she said.\n\n>As the chants grew in intensity, a lone police officer tried to escort her to safety. They were followed for blocks by hundreds of men and boys jeering in Hebrew and English.\n\n>Video shows two of the men kicking her in the back, another hurling a traffic cone into her head and a fourth pushing a trash can into her.\n\n>\u201cThis is America,\u201d one of the men can be heard saying. \u201cWe got Israel. We got an Army now.\u201d\n\n>At one point, she and the police officer were nearly cornered against a building, the video shows.\n\n>\u201cI felt sheer terror,\u201d the woman recalled. \u201cI realized at that point that I couldn\u2019t lead this mob of men to my home. I had nowhere to go. I didn\u2019t know what to do. I was just terrified.\u201d",

Browning argues that most of the men of \u00a0RPB 101 were not fanatical\u00a0Nazis but, rather, ordinary middle-aged, working-class men who committed these atrocities out of a mixture of motives, including the group dynamics of conformity, deference to authority, role adaptation, and the altering of moral norms to justify their actions. Very quickly three groups emerged within the battalion: a core of eager killers, a plurality who carried out their duties reliably but without initiative, and a small minority who evaded participation in the acts of killing without diminishing the murderous efficiency of the battalion whatsoever.\n\n>While this book discusses a specific Reserve Unit during WWII, the general argument Browning makes is that most people succumb to the pressures of a group setting and commit actions they would never do of their own volition. \u00a0\n\n>*Ordinary Men*\u00a0is a powerful, chilling, and important work with themes and arguments that continue to resonate today.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, Orpo must stand for Orlando Police",

She thought her husband, who had dementia, was trying to kill her and she \u201cescaped\u201d through a window and crawled through the snow to our home. When I first met them a couple of years earlier they were articulate and friendly folks who seemed wealthy and I might add somewhat narcissistic.\u00a0\n\nThe smell of their house was nauseating. Their dog was a filthy matted mess who looked more like a rescue off of the streets. He had pooped and peed all over the house and there were mouse droppings in their fridge. It was heart breaking and made me realize that we have to plan early before oor minds and bodies leave us in a vulnerable position.\u00a0",

                "Ever read Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland  by Christopher Browning?\n\n>\n\n>*Ordinary Men*\u00a0is the true story of Reserve Police Battalion 101 of the German Order Police, which was responsible for mass shootings as well as round-ups of Jewish people for deportation to Nazi death camps in Poland in 1942. Browning argues that most of the men of \u00a0RPB 101 were not fanatical\u00a0Nazis but, rather, ordinary middle-aged, working-class men who committed these atrocities out of a mixture of motives, including the group dynamics of conformity, deference to authority, role adaptation, and the altering of moral norms to justify their actions. Very quickly three groups emerged within the battalion: a core of eager killers, a plurality who carried out their duties reliably but without initiative, and a small minority who evaded participation in the acts of killing without diminishing the murderous efficiency of the battalion whatsoever.\n\n>While this book discusses a specific Reserve Unit during WWII, the general argument Browning makes is that most people succumb to the pressures of a group setting and commit actions they would never do of their own volition. \u00a0\n\n>*Ordinary Men*\u00a0is a powerful, chilling, and important work with themes and arguments that continue to resonate today.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, Orpo must stand for Orlando Police",
