Not everyone who has surgery has a support network to care for them and hospitals will not perform surgery unless you can be discharged into someone\u2019s care. So while it is true these \u201crecovery houses\u201d often care for plastic surgery patients, I\u2019ve seen them used by folks who needed non-elective surgeries. And no, you can\u2019t just call an uber driver to take you home because you have to be discharged with someone who can actually take care of you post-op. \n\nThere\u2019s minimal regulations and this is going to be another case where the new regulations are written in blood.",

The only info I can find refers to \"sober living homes,\" halfway houses, or debt recovery businesses. Even the 2024 Florida Statutes governing \"recovery residences\" refers to substance abuse and addiction and says nothing about procedures such plastic surgery.\n\nOne would think something like this would be covered by licensing requirements, but we are talking Florida here after all.",
                "I\u2019ve got a lot of friends who are primary care providers. I\u2019ve heard so many stories the last 5 years about patients of theirs who travel to Miami for plastic surg, usually a BBL, and come back for follow up treatment. \n\nBesides the unnecessary nature of the surgery, there\u2019s a massive issue where these surgeons are having their patients pursue pre surg authorization from their family care providers for an out of state, out of network procedure. Then they often send them home far too early (day of), and push all post surg follow up care back onto the family care provider because the surgeon discharged them and said they were good to go home and to talk to their family care provide. The patients aren\u2019t going to hop a flight back to Miami for care, so family med gets stuck with being cornered on taking out sutures and providing follow up care. It\u2019s taking a massive liability for something they\u2019re not really part of and it\u2019s frustrating for them to say the least.",
