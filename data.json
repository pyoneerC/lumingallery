                "> Mr. Mahdawi has not been accused of a crime. According to his lawyers, the Trump administration appears to be seeking his removal from the country under the same legal provision that it is using to detain another recent Columbia student and Palestinian, Mahmoud Khalil, contending that his presence is a threat to the foreign policy and national security interests of the United States. Immigration officials have argued that pro-Palestinian demonstrators have enabled the spread of antisemitism, but they have not offered evidence to substantiate the claim.\n\nThis is the real issue. Rubio can just say this guy\u2019s presence harms our foreign policy agenda and SCOTUS has already said a judge can\u2019t overrule that or challenge it in any way, despite Rubio not presenting any evidence to support it. \n\nSo, once again, if the government says you\u2019re a terrorist, they can deport you without any evidence of that, and ~~SCOTUS has affirmed that somehow that\u2019s legal and constitutional!~~\n\nEDIT: Clarifying one point (corrected above) - SCOTUS has not (yet) ruled on Khalil\u2019s case, that was a judge in Louisiana.
