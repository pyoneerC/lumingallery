That was **after** they unloaded an entire can of pepper spray directly into his face. Less than a second later, they fired the taser.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n* Full can of pepper spray to the face\n\n* One pathetic baton swing that missed\n\n* Taser deployed within a second of the failed batton strike.\n\n* All of this  happened within 60 seconds of entering the room.\n\nThese police are panicked, undertrained cowards who shouldn't be trusted with a flashlight, let alone a badge, pepper spray, or a taser.\n\nThen in the article it says: \n\n>Smith previously told jurors he did not see that the pensioner was disabled and using a wheelchair until after the incident, as he was focused on the knife.\n\nSo not only are they beyond incompetent, they are apparently blind as well. Top-tier awareness from the people we trust with weapons.\n\nI guess the wheelchair just blended in perfectly with the wallpaper. Totally reasonable for a trained officer to miss the one object that literally defines someone as physically disabled /s\n\nIf they\u2019re too unobservant to spot a mobility aid in plain sight, maybe policing isn\u2019t the job for them. You shouldn\u2019t be making split-second decisions with weapons if you can\u2019t handle basic awareness. Pick a job where nobody dies when you screw up FFS. \n\n>Meanwhile, Comotto said she believed using the Taser was the safest way to \"protect\" Mr Burgess as she feared her colleague using the baton again would cause more harm.\n\nJesus Christ. Even if the baton had broken his arm, what kind of absolute dimwit thinks that blasting a 92-year-old with 50,000+ volts is somehow less harmful? You have to be terminally dense to believe electrocuting a frail elderly man is the safer option.",

Less than a second later, they fired the taser.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n* Full can of pepper spray to the face\n\n* One pathetic baton swing that missed\n\n* Taser deployed within a second of the failed batton strike.\n\n* All of this  happened within 60 seconds of entering the room.\n\nThese police are panicked, undertrained cowards who shouldn't be trusted with a flashlight, let alone a badge, pepper spray, or a taser.\n\nThen in the article it says: \n\n>Smith previously told jurors he did not see that the pensioner was disabled and using a wheelchair until after the incident, as he was focused on the knife.\n\nSo not only are they beyond incompetent, they are apparently blind as well. Top-tier awareness from the people we trust with weapons.\n\nI guess the wheelchair just blended in perfectly with the wallpaper. Totally reasonable for a trained officer to miss the one object that literally defines someone as physically disabled /s\n\nIf they\u2019re too unobservant to spot a mobility aid in plain sight, maybe policing isn\u2019t the job for them. You shouldn\u2019t be making split-second decisions with weapons if you can\u2019t handle basic awareness. Pick a job where nobody dies when you screw up FFS. \n\n>Meanwhile, Comotto said she believed using the Taser was the safest way to \"protect\" Mr Burgess as she feared her colleague using the baton again would cause more harm.\n\nJesus Christ. Even if the baton had broken his arm, what kind of absolute dimwit thinks that blasting a 92-year-old with 50,000+ volts is somehow less harmful? You have to be terminally dense to believe electrocuting a frail elderly man is the safer option.",

That was **after** they unloaded an entire can of pepper spray directly into his face. Less than a second later, they fired the taser.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n* Full can of pepper spray to the face\n\n* One pathetic baton swing that missed\n\n* Taser deployed within a second of the failed batton strike.\n\n* All of this  happened within 60 seconds of entering the room.\n\nThese police are panicked, undertrained cowards who shouldn't be trusted with a flashlight, let alone a badge, pepper spray, or a taser.\n\nThen in the article it says: \n\n>Smith previously told jurors he did not see that the pensioner was disabled and using a wheelchair until after the incident, as he was focused on the knife.\n\nSo not only are they beyond incompetent, they are apparently blind as well. Top-tier awareness from the people we trust with weapons.\n\nI guess the wheelchair just blended in perfectly with the wallpaper. Totally reasonable for a trained officer to miss the one object that literally defines someone as physically disabled /s\n\nIf they\u2019re too unobservant to spot a mobility aid in plain sight, maybe policing isn\u2019t the job for them. You shouldn\u2019t be making split-second decisions with weapons if you can\u2019t handle basic awareness. Pick a job where nobody dies when you screw up FFS. \n\n>Meanwhile, Comotto said she believed using the Taser was the safest way to \"protect\" Mr Burgess as she feared her colleague using the baton again would cause more harm.\n\nJesus Christ. Even if the baton had broken his arm, what kind of absolute dimwit thinks that blasting a 92-year-old with 50,000+ volts is somehow less harmful? You have to be terminally dense to believe electrocuting a frail elderly man is the safer option.",
