The program itself has nothing to do with racism.\n\nThe program is simply because 1 in 3 people there have intestinal parasitic hookworms, due to an extremely unsafe lack of proper sanitation.\n\nThe REASON this area has zero infrastructure for good sanitation is because the federal government and the state of Alabama have been extremely racist for 150 years, since black people were allowed to own land. The only place they were allowed to buy land was an area which was very low and had soil which made it basically impossible to dig sanitation infrastructure. \n\nOn top of that, due to segregationist zoning laws and redlining, their parents and grandparents were prohibited from buying land elsewhere. \n\nNow, they cannot move because the land they live on is basically worthless - nobody would want to buy their property for a reasonable price - and they cannot climb out of poverty due to suppressed wages and higher medical bills - due to the lack of sanitation.\n\nCan't sell the land, can't get better wages, can't climb out of poverty. \n\nThis is true for all the people there, regardless of race.\n\nSo, to repeat myself: the *current program* has nothing to do with DEI and race. Everyone who lives there benefits from it.\n\nThis is  also a perfect example of Critical Race Theory - it's not about anyone *currently* being racist. It's just that centuries of racism created this situation, and we need to fix it. \n\nDonald Trump, and Republicans, want to get rid of it because *they* are racist, though."

According to reports, the cook served the meal even after removing the snake from the food, resulting in illnesses among the children and triggering angry protests from their families. The commission has requested local authorities to submit a detailed report, highlighting concerns of human rights violations and ongoing issues of poor food hygiene associated with India's free Mid-Day Meal scheme, a program aimed at encouraging school attendance among disadvantaged children.

The only place they were allowed to buy land was an area which was very low and had soil which made it basically impossible to dig sanitation infrastructure. \n\nOn top of that, due to segregationist zoning laws and redlining, their parents and grandparents were prohibited from buying land elsewhere. \n\nNow, they cannot move because the land they live on is basically worthless - nobody would want to buy their property for a reasonable price - and they cannot climb out of poverty due to suppressed wages and higher medical bills - due to the lack of sanitation.\n\nCan't sell the land, can't get better wages, can't climb out of poverty. \n\nThis is true for all the people there, regardless of race.\n\nSo, to repeat myself: the *current program* has nothing to do with DEI and race. Everyone who lives there benefits from it.\n\nThis is  also a perfect example of Critical Race Theory - it's not about anyone *currently* being racist. It's just that centuries of racism created this situation, and we need to fix it. \n\nDonald Trump, and Republicans, want to get rid of it because *they* are racist, though."
