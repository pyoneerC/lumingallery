The fact detainees only receive notice \"roughly 24 hours before removal, devoid of information about how to exercise due process rights to contest that removal\" is an intended cruelty by this administration. They don't care if you're innocent or not, they will use every trick at their disposal to secure an express deportation so that once you're gone they can claim whatever they want about you. Even in the high profile case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia when everything points to the deportee's innocence, the Trump administration is confronted and even ordered to return him to the US yet all they have to say is he'll \u201cnever live in the United States of America again\u201d and nothing is done.\n\nAs a citizen of the United States you might think you have nothing to worry about, but do you feel confident you could contest your deportation within 24 hours if they wrongfully claimed you were an illegal immigrant? Are you already familiar with the process or would you rely on Google and hope it all works out? Furthermore anyone familiar with federal offices know even the simplest of claims can be an excruciatingly slow process which begs the question, would your paperwork even reach anyone in time to contest your deportation?",

Monty Migliacio told ABC News on Friday.\n\nEmergency calls came in around 2:10 p.m. Thursday, reporting the fire, Migliacio told ABC News. The Iberville Sheriff's Department arrived first, followed quickly by firefighters who fought the blaze at the White Castle mansion for hours.\n\n\"It was the biggest fire I've seen in my entire 20-year career,\" Migliacio said.\n\nTen fire departments from surrounding areas worked together to contain the blaze and protect nearby buildings, according to officials.\n\nLouisiana Fire Marshalls are investigating the cause of the blaze, authorities said.\n\nOfficials confirmed that no one was injured. It is unknown if anyone was touring the mansion at the time of the fire, they said.\n\nIberville Parish President Chris Daigle highlighted the mansion's historical significance of the loss in a statement posted on Facebook.\n\n\"Nottoway was not only the largest remaining antebellum mansion in the South but also a symbol of both the grandeur and the deep complexities of our region's past,\" Daigle said.\n\nHe noted that it was built in 1859 and had been open to visitors since the '80s.",

The fact detainees only receive notice \"roughly 24 hours before removal, devoid of information about how to exercise due process rights to contest that removal\" is an intended cruelty by this administration.

Are you already familiar with the process or would you rely on Google and hope it all works out?
