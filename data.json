We have no money. I just moved here,\u201d the mother said. \u201cI have to feed my children. I\u2019m going to need gas money. I need to be able to get around. Like, how do you just leave me like this? Like an abandoned dog.\u201d\n\nShe said the agents ordered her and her daughters to step outside, even though it was raining and they barely were given time to put on clothes.\n\n\u201c**They wanted me to change in front of all of them, in between all of them**,\u201d she said. \u201cMy husband has not even seen my daughter in her undergarments \u2014 her own dad, because it\u2019s respectful. **You have her out there, a minor, in her underwear,**\u201d the woman told KFOR.\n\n\u201cOne of them said, \u2018I know it was a little rough this morning,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt was so denigrating. That you do all of this to a family, to women, your fellow citizens. And it was a little rough? You literally traumatized me and my daughters for life. We\u2019re going to have to go get help or get over this somehow.\u201d\n\nBefore the agents left, the mother asked when could the family get their belongings back and they said **it could be days or even months,** KFOR reported.\n\nEdit: Other news sources clarified that **20 men** broke into the house in the middle of the night while they were sleeping. So 20 men surrounded this woman and her three young daughters, dragged them out into the rain in their underwear, and made them change clothes in front of them. If there was any justice in this  country they would be up on charges of sexual exploitation of minors.\n\n2nd Edit: The ~~agents~~ stasi thugs wouldn't even leave a business card or phone number they could call to find out how to get their electronics and life savings back.

Most organizations (school districts for example) have insurance for when things need a big payout like this, but you can\u2019t get insurance to pay out for sexual assaults in these cases as the insuring organization when the crime was committed have been gone out of business and current insurance plans do not cover this kind of crime.

We have no money. I just moved here,\u201d the mother said. \u201cI have to feed my children. I\u2019m going to need gas money. I need to be able to get around. Like, how do you just leave me like this? Like an abandoned dog.\u201d\n\nShe said the agents ordered her and her daughters to step outside, even though it was raining and they barely were given time to put on clothes.\n\n\u201c**They wanted me to change in front of all of them, in between all of them**,\u201d she said. \u201cMy husband has not even seen my daughter in her undergarments \u2014 her own dad, because it\u2019s respectful. **You have her out there, a minor, in her underwear,**\u201d the woman told KFOR.\n\n\u201cOne of them said, \u2018I know it was a little rough this morning,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt was so denigrating. That you do all of this to a family, to women, your fellow citizens. And it was a little rough? You literally traumatized me and my daughters for life. We\u2019re going to have to go get help or get over this somehow.\u201d\n\nBefore the agents left, the mother asked when could the family get their belongings back and they said **it could be days or even months,** KFOR reported.\n\nEdit: Other news sources clarified that **20 men** broke into the house in the middle of the night while they were sleeping. So 20 men surrounded this woman and her three young daughters, dragged them out into the rain in their underwear, and made them change clothes in front of them. If there was any justice in this  country they would be up on charges of sexual exploitation of minors.\n\n2nd Edit: The ~~agents~~ stasi thugs wouldn't even leave a business card or phone number they could call to find out how to get their electronics and life savings back. The ~~agents~~ thieves refused to even tell them which government agency or department would be storing their property.",

                "AB 218 is a law that extends the statute of limitations for sexual assault victims. Many of the cases occurred in the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s. Only the victim is alive, and nobody connected with assault is at the facility anymore. Most organizations (school districts for example) have insurance for when things need a big payout like this, but you can\u2019t get insurance to pay out for sexual assaults in these cases as the insuring organization when the crime was committed have been gone out of business and current insurance plans do not cover this kind of crime.  That means the payout comes from a general fund, the same fund that they pay their employees from and where they find money to fix facilities. \n\nI\u2019m not denying the heinous nature of the crimes these sexual assault survivors have had to endure, or the long term effects of those acts, how it likely played a role in many of not all of their actions and decisions since. But in many cases nobody connected with the crimes works for the organization anymore and hasn\u2019t been for decades, but they are left with the bill. \n\nBecause of these cases there has been a significant shortfall in funding for nurses, teachers and other affected industries as they have had to pay out millions to victims that would have otherwise gone to increase pay for their staff. \n\nI am not trying to diminish anyone\u2019s suffering but it\u2019s like someone saying they were assaulted in a house 50 years ago and even though you moved in 5 years ago you\u2019re responsible for crime because you live there now.\n\n\nSource: I am a school board member in a small district (we thankfully have not had an cases of SA) who participated in a legislative advocacy and AB 218 was one of the bills we discussed",

We have no money. I just moved here,\u201d the mother said. \u201cI have to feed my children. I\u2019m going to need gas money. I need to be able to get around. Like, how do you just leave me like this?

That you do all of this to a family, to women, your fellow citizens. And it was a little rough? You literally traumatized me and my daughters for life. We\u2019re going to have to go get help or get over this somehow.\u201d\n\nBefore the agents left, the mother asked when could the family get their belongings back and they said **it could be days or even months,** KFOR reported.\n\nEdit: Other news sources clarified that **20 men** broke into the house in the middle of the night while they were sleeping. So 20 men surrounded this woman and her three young daughters, dragged them out into the rain in their underwear, and made them change clothes in front of them. If there was any justice in this  country they would be up on charges of sexual exploitation of minors.\n\n2nd Edit: The ~~agents~~ stasi thugs wouldn't even leave a business card or phone number they could call to find out how to get their electronics and life savings back.

Only the victim is alive, and nobody connected with assault is at the facility anymore. Most organizations (school districts for example) have insurance for when things need a big payout like this, but you can\u2019t get insurance to pay out for sexual assaults in these cases as the insuring organization when the crime was committed have been gone out of business and current insurance plans do not cover this kind of crime.

But in many cases nobody connected with the crimes works for the organization anymore and hasn\u2019t been for decades, but they are left with the bill. \n\nBecause of these cases there has been a significant shortfall in funding for nurses, teachers and other affected industries as they have had to pay out millions to victims that would have otherwise gone to increase pay for their staff. \n\nI am not trying to diminish anyone\u2019s suffering but it\u2019s like someone saying they were assaulted in a house 50 years ago and even though you moved in 5 years ago you\u2019re responsible for crime because you live there now.\n\n\nSource: I am a school board member in a small district (we thankfully have not had an cases of SA) who participated in a legislative advocacy and AB 218 was one of the bills we discussed",
