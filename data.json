                "TLDR; Former Illinois Governor George Ryan passed away on May 2, 2025, at the age of 91 in Kankakee, Illinois, while under hospice care. A Republican known for his pragmatism, Ryan served as governor from 1999 to 2003. He gained international recognition for halting executions and commuting all death row sentences in Illinois, citing systemic injustices in the capital punishment system. However, his career was marred by a corruption scandal dating back to his tenure as secretary of state, leading to a 2006 conviction for racketeering, bribery, extortion, money laundering, and tax fraud. He served over five years in federal prison and was released in 2013.",
                "A relative met him and he was quite kind, goofy, and grandfatherly - at a time when we had just lost ours. It's a shame he marred his name with corruption. IL's 'wiretap' laws (all party consent everywhere audio recording) basically exist to protect this kind of crap, so it's no wonder IL's history of corruption is long and deep.",
                "If you are a top politician in Illinois and not engaging in corruption are you really even trying?",
                "Didn't have to mention that an Illinois governor went to prison for corruption.  It's just implied.",

It\u2019s people like them that gave me the strong urge to move 2500 miles away from there. Illinois is the worst. They act like Chicago is the only problem when 90% of the state is small towns filled with small, racist, xenophobic, nativist, homophobic, climate denying, misogynistic, anti-intellectualism minds."

However, his career was marred by a corruption scandal dating back to his tenure as secretary of state, leading to a 2006 conviction for racketeering, bribery, extortion, money laundering, and tax fraud. He served over five years in federal prison and was released in 2013.",
                "A relative met him and he was quite kind, goofy, and grandfatherly - at a time when we had just lost ours. It's a shame he marred his name with corruption. IL's 'wiretap' laws (all party consent everywhere audio recording) basically exist to protect this kind of crap, so it's no wonder IL's history of corruption is long and deep.",

                "I\u2019m from the Kankakee area and that family was/is such an embarrassment, though many there probably support them. GR Jr is a scumbag. I used to bartend there back in the day and my boss was one of his friends so that group would come into the bar all the time, plus I just heard ALL the gossip. It\u2019s people like them that gave me the strong urge to move 2500 miles away from there. Illinois is the worst. They act like Chicago is the only problem when 90% of the state is small towns filled with small, racist, xenophobic, nativist, homophobic, climate denying, misogynistic, anti-intellectualism minds."

Many years of scientific research and the funding that supported it will rot on the vine because they're effectively preventing the harvest.  They're f@#$&# liquidating taxpayer investments before they mature... At best to claim they saved a buck.  At worst to intentionally sabotage the government, the dollar, the country, and modern western society.",
