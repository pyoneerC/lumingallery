                "> The unsigned decision in the case, the most closely watched emergency appeal pending at the Supreme Court, lets Trump invoke the 1798 law to speed removals while litigation over the act\u2019s use plays out in lower courts. The court stressed that people deported going forward should receive notice they are subject to the act and an opportunity to have their removal reviewed.\n\nThis strikes me as SCOTUS knowing it won't stand up, but wanting to give the administration more time to mass deport people until the cases play out in the lower courts and actually require a final decision from them. It's the same thing they did with the presidential immunity case. Delay enough that the damage is done by the time they make a decision.\n\n\n> The court\u2019s three liberal justices dissented from the decision, and Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a member of the court\u2019s conservative wing, partially dissented.\n\nAmy Coney Barrett being the dark horse.

By the time they drag me out, the message is clear. Everyone will have their camera in hand - I would have one those obnoxious air horns to be sure it becomes part of the graduation memories."
