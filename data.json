The finding is the lynchpin for the agency\u2019s regulations about greenhouse gas pollution under the Clean Air Act.\u00a0",

Most voters, and even middle aged to early 50s aged politicians and CEOs, etc, were at most wearing diapers before or during the Carter Administration.\n\n  \nThe only people who understand why the EPA was created are either old or young and history nerds.\n\n  \nBut whatever, I can't wait for the sky to be orange and there to be junk cars and trash floating down the river like in one of those stock film reels made by Documerica.

Husband was the last to travel alone after closing up the old house. He was driving through a mountainous area and veered off the road. His car landed in a very wooded area many feet below the highway and not visible. He was pinned hanging upside down and could not get down or out of the car. Couldn\u2019t reach the phone and the battery eventually died. Authorities were reluctant to do deep search because he had not been missing 24 hours. They said he could have stopped off to eat or rest. She reached out to friends and family and anyone who would help. They were able to narrow down the search area on the basis of his last conversation with his wife. The only reason they finally found him was a bright red dolly fell out of his truck during the accident and the handle was sticking out of a visible area.

The finding is the lynchpin for the agency\u2019s regulations about greenhouse gas pollution under the Clean Air Act.\u00a0",

The finding is the lynchpin for the agency\u2019s regulations about greenhouse gas pollution under the Clean Air Act.\u00a0",

Most voters, and even middle aged to early 50s aged politicians and CEOs, etc, were at most wearing diapers before or during the Carter Administration.\n\n  \nThe only people who understand why the EPA was created are either old or young and history nerds.\n\n  \nBut whatever, I can't wait for the sky to be orange and there to be junk cars and trash floating down the river like in one of those stock film reels made by Documerica.

It's because we know how much hypocritical they are and because we know they will always look the other way when their people and allies are violating them.\n\nYet they ask us to help with Ukraine when they need it and are astonished when we refused. It's always a one-way street with them. We have to do the right thing because it's right while they can wrong us all they want. Still, they will continue to support this apartheid against while asking us for compassion for them when they had none for us.\n\nWe don't care about any of that and we don't want them to lecture us on anything because we know they will mess us when they can and we don't want them to preach their values to us because we will never accept them. If they don't like, then that's their problem."
