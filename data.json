Some of these hospitalized children will need to be put on a ventilator to recover, Stinchfield said.\nIn about 1 in 1,000 cases, measles causes brain swelling, or encephalitis, which can cause seizures. When it's not fatal, the swelling itself can subside, but it can cause permanent brain damage and other lasting side effects, such as blindness or deafness. \nThe measles virus is capable of replicating in the brain, said Ross Kedl, a professor of immunology at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. In some cases, the immune system beats the virus back and the person seems to recover, but measles still lurks in their nervous system.\n\n> The nightmarish effect of this long-term persistence is a condition called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). This is a progressive neurological disorder that might start with mood changes and muscle tremors; then, as it progresses, the person starts losing speech, vision and hearing. After about two years, the person falls into a coma and dies. \n\n\nIt can also erase antibodies that their bodies have created to fight other diseases.

We are seeing this as an opportunity and we have tangible success stories that have confirmed the value that this campaign has,\u201d says Laura O\u2019Brien, Nova Scotia Health manager of recruitment services. \n\n\u201cWe are learning from the high interest that our recruitment efforts are working, health-care professionals and nurses are worried about the uncertainties in the American health-care system. The interest has been so, so much more and we are taking advantage of that.\u201d\n\t\u2022\tDownload the CTV News App for breaking news alerts and video on all the top stories\nNova Scotia Health says it received 65 serious inquiries from U.S. health-care workers that asked about licensing\u201cWhat\u2019s been great so far in seeing the results from this campaign is that we are seeing experienced nurses and experienced health-care workers. As recruiters here in Nova Scotia, student engagement is one of our top priorities but it is great to have as many graduates as we possibly can but we need those experienced professionals as well and this is giving us an opportunity to leverage that,\u201d says O\u2019Brien. \n\nHealth-care workers could be looking to leave the United States for a variety of reasons, but Nova Scotia Health believe politics is playing a part.\u201cThe number one reason is they are feeling uncertain, they\u2019re feeling very uncomfortable depending on their current situation and how they are being portrayed. And I think they just don\u2019t see a future for themselves anymore in that country,\u201d says O\u2019Brien. Roughly 30 per cent of the province\u2019s recruitment is international and Nova Scotia Health has seen a recent uptick in interest from the U.S.\u201cIt really started in March of 2023 when Nova Scotia became the first province to allow U.S board-certified physicians to practice in Nova Scotia with additional certifications, so we saw an uptick then and really double the numbers of U.S physicians,\u201d says Katrina Philopoulos, Nova Scotia Health physician recruitment director.",

We are seeing this as an opportunity and we have tangible success stories that have confirmed the value that this campaign has,\u201d says Laura O\u2019Brien, Nova Scotia Health manager of recruitment services. \n\n\u201cWe are learning from the high interest that our recruitment efforts are working, health-care professionals and nurses are worried about the uncertainties in the American health-care system. The interest has been so, so much more and we are taking advantage of that.\u201d\n\t\u2022\tDownload the CTV News App for breaking news alerts and video on all the top stories\nNova Scotia Health says it received 65 serious inquiries from U.S. health-care workers that asked about licensing\u201cWhat\u2019s been great so far in seeing the results from this campaign is that we are seeing experienced nurses and experienced health-care workers. As recruiters here in Nova Scotia, student engagement is one of our top priorities but it is great to have as many graduates as we possibly can but we need those experienced professionals as well and this is giving us an opportunity to leverage that,\u201d says O\u2019Brien. \n\nHealth-care workers could be looking to leave the United States for a variety of reasons, but Nova Scotia Health believe politics is playing a part.\u201cThe number one reason is they are feeling uncertain, they\u2019re feeling very uncomfortable depending on their current situation and how they are being portrayed. And I think they just don\u2019t see a future for themselves anymore in that country,\u201d says O\u2019Brien. Roughly 30 per cent of the province\u2019s recruitment is international and Nova Scotia Health has seen a recent uptick in interest from the U.S.\u201cIt really started in March of 2023 when Nova Scotia became the first province to allow U.S board-certified physicians to practice in Nova Scotia with additional certifications, so we saw an uptick then and really double the numbers of U.S physicians,\u201d says Katrina Philopoulos, Nova Scotia Health physician recruitment director.",

Some of these hospitalized children will need to be put on a ventilator to recover, Stinchfield said.\nIn about 1 in 1,000 cases, measles causes brain swelling, or encephalitis, which can cause seizures. When it's not fatal, the swelling itself can subside, but it can cause permanent brain damage and other lasting side effects, such as blindness or deafness. \nThe measles virus is capable of replicating in the brain, said Ross Kedl, a professor of immunology at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. In some cases, the immune system beats the virus back and the person seems to recover, but measles still lurks in their nervous system.\n\n> The nightmarish effect of this long-term persistence is a condition called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). This is a progressive neurological disorder that might start with mood changes and muscle tremors; then, as it progresses, the person starts losing speech, vision and hearing. After about two years, the person falls into a coma and dies. \n\n\nIt can also erase antibodies that their bodies have created to fight other diseases.

The interest has been so, so much more and we are taking advantage of that.\u201d\n\t\u2022\tDownload the CTV News App for breaking news alerts and video on all the top stories\nNova Scotia Health says it received 65 serious inquiries from U.S. health-care workers that asked about licensing\u201cWhat\u2019s been great so far in seeing the results from this campaign is that we are seeing experienced nurses and experienced health-care workers. As recruiters here in Nova Scotia, student engagement is one of our top priorities but it is great to have as many graduates as we possibly can but we need those experienced professionals as well and this is giving us an opportunity to leverage that,\u201d says O\u2019Brien. \n\nHealth-care workers could be looking to leave the United States for a variety of reasons, but Nova Scotia Health believe politics is playing a part.\u201cThe number one reason is they are feeling uncertain, they\u2019re feeling very uncomfortable depending on their current situation and how they are being portrayed. And I think they just don\u2019t see a future for themselves anymore in that country,\u201d says O\u2019Brien. Roughly 30 per cent of the province\u2019s recruitment is international and Nova Scotia Health has seen a recent uptick in interest from the U.S.\u201cIt really started in March of 2023 when Nova Scotia became the first province to allow U.S board-certified physicians to practice in Nova Scotia with additional certifications, so we saw an uptick then and really double the numbers of U.S physicians,\u201d says Katrina Philopoulos, Nova Scotia Health physician recruitment director.",

Some of these hospitalized children will need to be put on a ventilator to recover, Stinchfield said.\nIn about 1 in 1,000 cases, measles causes brain swelling, or encephalitis, which can cause seizures. When it's not fatal, the swelling itself can subside, but it can cause permanent brain damage and other lasting side effects, such as blindness or deafness. \nThe measles virus is capable of replicating in the brain, said Ross Kedl, a professor of immunology at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. In some cases, the immune system beats the virus back and the person seems to recover, but measles still lurks in their nervous system.\n\n> The nightmarish effect of this long-term persistence is a condition called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). This is a progressive neurological disorder that might start with mood changes and muscle tremors; then, as it progresses, the person starts losing speech, vision and hearing. After about two years, the person falls into a coma and dies. \n\n\nIt can also erase antibodies that their bodies have created to fight other diseases.
