With $18.2 million (20% of $91.2 mil after your absurdly generous family gift) invested in those you will pull down $638,400 per year. If everything else blows up, you still have that, and you will be in the top 1% of income in the United States. So how about you not fuck with it. Eh? And that\u2019s income that is damn safe. **If we get to the point where the United States defaults on those instruments, we are in far worse shape than worrying about money.**\n\n> If you are really paranoid, you might consider picking another G7 or otherwise mainstream country other than the U.S. according to where you want to live **if the United States dissolves into anarchy or Britney Spears is elected to the United States Senate.**\n\n> You have provided for your family beyond your wildest dreams.
