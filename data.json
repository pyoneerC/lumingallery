The school is in the process of repatriating or sending back skulls to their original locations. That initial call set in motion the creation of the Cultural Repatriation Committee, led by Baham.\n\n>\u201cWe are not talking about them as if they are skeletal remains,\u201d Baham said at the news conference. \u201cWe want to honor them by calling them the individuals that they are.\u201d\n\n>Dillard, one of two historically Black universities in New Orleans, along with Xavier University of Louisiana, welcomed the opportunity to be part of \u201cthis very sensitive acknowledgment of our people, that they are here,\u201d Guillory told NBC News.

And of course it was all done without permission.\n\nIt's 150 years after the fact, but at least they've finally been laid to rest and given some dignity back.",

                ">One woman said she was assaulted at least 20 times while working for Robinson from 2012 until 2024. Another said she worked for him from 2014 until 2020 and was assaulted at least 23 times. \n\nWhen I first heard about the rape allegations, the time line always bothered me. The first rape accusations were linked with allegations of poor pay, bad work conditions, and were secondary to the labor allegations. In fact the first reporting indicated that they hadn\u2019t even filed a police complaint yet. At the time I thought if he was paying them less than minimum wages, why not just quit and find another job. I mean if they had a work history of 12 years working for one family how hard would it be to find another job. Again the sexual assault was secondary in the reporting and they weren\u2019t pressing for criminal charges. Also if I recall correctly there were only two housekeepers at the time. Also it was hard to get a sense of when the rapes occurred. Was it 4 a year for the period between 2014-2020, or 2 a year for the period between 2012-2024 or did they all happen in 2019. A very confusing situation and as in most of these cases the reporting and reality may bear little relation to each other. So wait and see.",
                "A*ttorneys for the former housekeepers, said in a statement that the defamation suit \u201cis nothing more than an attempt to silence and intimidate the survivors of Mr. Robinson\u2019s sexual battery and assault. It is a baseless and vindictive legal maneuver designed to re-victimize, shift blame and discourage others from coming forward*.\u201d\n\nThe Robinsons counter-suit is just a way to silence people who sue. Robinson's spending money on these housekeepers has zero to do with proving himself innocent of sexual assaults,  That's just more bull.",
                "I don't have strong feelings either way about Smokey Robinson (don't know much about him) but I'd be curious what their evidence is, if they have any other than their claims. It does sort of feel like they want to cash in before he dies. But I saw mention some of them are not citizens and immigrants are easy to take advantage of, so who knows.\n\nFrom what I understand, they wanted big money and he wouldn't pay, so then they filed a police complaint to force an investigation. With 4 victims, I feel like the police will be able to find any obvious inconsistencies in their stories.\n\nEven if you assume he is innocent, I'm never sure how I feel about the strategy of counter suing. I doubt they have any money if you win, and you're just keeping the story in the headlines.",
