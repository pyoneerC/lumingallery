The man she was visiting has been charged with murder in connection with her killing, Riebe said.\n\n>Dowells, a hairdresser, was killed while visiting her husband, David Brinson, 54, who was convicted in the 1990s of murdering four men during a robbery, and sentenced to four consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole.\n\n>After Brinson called prison officials at 2:04 a.m. on Nov. 13 to tell them his wife had passed out, officers immediately began life-saving measures and called 911, a spokesperson for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said. \n\n>But Dowells was pronounced dead a short time later.\n\n>Dowells\u2019 killing remains under investigation by prison officials and the district attorney\u2019s office, the spokesperson said. \n\n>Riebe said charges are pending prison and autopsy reports.",

They trusted this man enough to let their 3 year old visit him. Like what kind of vetting process is the prison using? The prison needs to answer for this. These weren't random acts they gave violent offenders private access to vulnerable visitors. How many more women need to die before they fix this broken system?",

Later on when I went to work at a nearby casino, one of my reports was a former corrections officer at that prison and he told me that most of those guys are \"short-timers\" or had mild offenses on good behavior. I asked \"Has anybody run off before?\" He says \"Of course. These guys are the dumbest guys on the planet. One fellow had his girlfriend pick him up in the parking lot and they took off. Sheriff caught them in an under hour. Guy added five years to his term for pulling that stunt.\" Before that he was literally 4 weeks away from his release date.",
