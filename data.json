                "CLARKSVILLE, TN (CLARKSVILLE NOW) \u2013 After three days of testimony and only 1 hour and 20 minutes of jury deliberation, Theary Lim, charged with killing her Army veteran husband, was found guilty of first-degree murder on Wednesday and immediately sentenced to life in prison.\n\nOn Jan. 3, 2022, Clarksville Police conducted a welfare check in the 2200 block of Ladd Drive. Upon arrival, they found 38-year-old Sothon In dead from a gunshot wound to the head. Nearby, his wife, 32-year-old Theary Lim, and her two children were on the floor under a blanket. The next day, Theary Lim was arrested and charged.\n\nProsecution: \u2018This wasn\u2019t an accident, this was calculated\u2019\nDuring closing arguments, Assistant District Attorney Crystal Morgan displayed a professional photograph to the jury of Theary Lim holding a firearm, a leg holster secured to her thigh, and a T-shirt with the words \u201cGirls just want to have guns\u201d printed on the back.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the defendant\u2019s own statement to Detective (Keenan) Carlton: She admits she had the gun in her hands. She was playing with the gun, she shook it, and it went off,\u201d Morgan told the jury.\n\nMorgan referred to the medical examiner\u2019s testimony that the bullet entered through Sothon\u2019s forehead and exited out the back. She stated the defendant would had to have been standing beside the bed at close range, within 3 feet, when she fired the shot.\n\n\u201cShe left her husband in that bedroom for hours to die,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cA nine-hour and four-minute window that Sothon lay in that bedroom \u2013 with the defendant and his children in the house \u2013 dead.\n\n\u201cIt was an accident?\u201d Morgan said. \u201cWhat we have to believe to accept that statement is that she retrieved a gun, decided to play with it at the head of her sleeping husband.\u201d Morgan cited testimony from an expert witness who stated it would take 7 pounds of pressure on the trigger in order for that gun to go off. \u201cDoes that pass your common sense?\n\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t an accident, ladies and gentlemen,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cIt was premeditated. It was calculated. She locks the door at 12:15 (p.m.), she closes the blinds after he\u2019s shot, and at 12:59 (p.m.) she unlocks the door. \u2026 Hold her responsible. Find her guilty.\u201d\n\nDefense: How many unanswered questions can you live with?\nWhile Theary\u2019s attorney, Chase Smith, waived opening remarks, he did not pass up on closing arguments. \u201cHow many unanswered questions can you have and still find someone guilty of premeditated first-degree murder?\u201d Chase Smith asked. \u201cMoral certainty is required, absolute certainty is not.\u201d\n\nSmith explained this means that when the trial is over and the jury is allowed to speak about the case, they need to be able to \u201cwithout hesitation\u201d explain why they found her guilty, why she shot him, why she did it intentionally, and why it was premeditated.\n\nHe pointed out what he called flaws in the state\u2019s case and with their witnesses. Smith mentioned a \u201cdrive-thru forensic test\u201d explaining that it took three years to get a test back on the gunshot residue kit from the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, a test that once it was started, only took one day to complete and get results. And he called the results confusing.\n\n\u201cAll the (GSR) was on her left hand, none on her right hand,\u201d Smith said before showing the same picture of Theary that the state published. \u201cThe picture the state put in, she has the gun in her right hand.\u201d Smith pulled out a form his client signed that waived her right to testify. \u201cShe signs that waiver with her right hand.\u201d\n\nSmith furthered his point by referencing the medical examiner report. Though the gun was close to the victims head, it wasn\u2019t close enough to leave a muzzle stamp, meaning there wasn\u2019t hard contact. \u201cNo pressure, no press down like you want to really kill somebody because you\u2019re mad.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t prove that she shot him,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWhat if he shot himself? What if one of the kids shot him? If you have a significant amount of unanswered questions, you\u2019ve got to ask yourselves, how many can you have and still be certain that she\u2019s guilty?\u201d Smith asked the jury.\n\nSentenced to life in prison\nTheary Lim was found guilty as charged of first-degree murder. After the jury was dismissed, a sentencing was immediately held.\n\nIn the state of Tennessee, if any individual is found guilty of first-degree murder, it is a mandatory life sentence (60 years). The only charge Theary was facing was the murder charge. Judge Robert Bateman imposed an immediate life sentence, minus credited time served up to 15%, for a minimum of 51 years in prison.",
                "What was the motive?  I have no problem holding her responsible for the death, but first degree murder and no established motive?",
                "reading the case. \n\nyeah it was on purpose.\n\ndo gun trigger some time fail .(many recalls on that) but if gun was used before said event.\n\nit would have been easy to spot or notice in the gun.",
                "It's been proven that most gun-related accidents are usually their own family members.\n\n\nHell, my older brother almost shot me once, I was staying with him and came home one night super late. He had his gun drawn on me, and I told him I came in through the front door and had keys and everything lol.\n\n\nAn intruder wouldn't enter that way, nor have keys.\n\n\nI feel like owning a gun makes people jumpy with it, like they *want* to use it on something to justify owning it.",

We have no money. I just moved here,\u201d the mother said. \u201cI have to feed my children. I\u2019m going to need gas money. I need to be able to get around. Like, how do you just leave me like this? Like an abandoned dog.\u201d\n\nShe said the agents ordered her and her daughters to step outside, even though it was raining and they barely were given time to put on clothes.\n\n\u201c**They wanted me to change in front of all of them, in between all of them**,\u201d she said. \u201cMy husband has not even seen my daughter in her undergarments \u2014 her own dad, because it\u2019s respectful. **You have her out there, a minor, in her underwear,**\u201d the woman told KFOR.\n\n\u201cOne of them said, \u2018I know it was a little rough this morning,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt was so denigrating. That you do all of this to a family, to women, your fellow citizens. And it was a little rough? You literally traumatized me and my daughters for life. We\u2019re going to have to go get help or get over this somehow.\u201d\n\nBefore the agents left, the mother asked when could the family get their belongings back and they said **it could be days or even months,** KFOR reported.\n\nEdit: Other news sources clarified that **20 men** broke into the house in the middle of the night while they were sleeping. So 20 men surrounded this woman and her three young daughters, dragged them out into the rain in their underwear, and made them change clothes in front of them. If there was any justice in this  country they would be up on charges of sexual exploitation of minors.\n\n2nd Edit: The ~~agents~~ stasi thugs wouldn't even leave a business card or phone number they could call to find out how to get their electronics and life savings back. The ~~agents~~ thieves refused to even tell them which government agency or department would be storing their property.",

Can you just reprogram yourself and see us as humans, as women? A little bit of mercy. Care a little bit about your fellow human, about your fellow citizen, fellow resident. We bleed too. We work. We bleed just like anybody else bleeds. We\u2019re scared. You could see our faces that we were terrified. What makes you so much more worthier of your peace? What makes you so much more worthier of protecting your children? What makes you so much more worthy of your citizenship? What makes you more worthy of safety? Of being given the right that they took from me to protect my daughters?\u201d"

                "CLARKSVILLE, TN (CLARKSVILLE NOW) \u2013 After three days of testimony and only 1 hour and 20 minutes of jury deliberation, Theary Lim, charged with killing her Army veteran husband, was found guilty of first-degree murder on Wednesday and immediately sentenced to life in prison.\n\nOn Jan. 3, 2022, Clarksville Police conducted a welfare check in the 2200 block of Ladd Drive. Upon arrival, they found 38-year-old Sothon In dead from a gunshot wound to the head. Nearby, his wife, 32-year-old Theary Lim, and her two children were on the floor under a blanket. The next day, Theary Lim was arrested and charged.\n\nProsecution: \u2018This wasn\u2019t an accident, this was calculated\u2019\nDuring closing arguments, Assistant District Attorney Crystal Morgan displayed a professional photograph to the jury of Theary Lim holding a firearm, a leg holster secured to her thigh, and a T-shirt with the words \u201cGirls just want to have guns\u201d printed on the back.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the defendant\u2019s own statement to Detective (Keenan) Carlton: She admits she had the gun in her hands. She was playing with the gun, she shook it, and it went off,\u201d Morgan told the jury.\n\nMorgan referred to the medical examiner\u2019s testimony that the bullet entered through Sothon\u2019s forehead and exited out the back. She stated the defendant would had to have been standing beside the bed at close range, within 3 feet, when she fired the shot.\n\n\u201cShe left her husband in that bedroom for hours to die,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cA nine-hour and four-minute window that Sothon lay in that bedroom \u2013 with the defendant and his children in the house \u2013 dead.\n\n\u201cIt was an accident?\u201d Morgan said. \u201cWhat we have to believe to accept that statement is that she retrieved a gun, decided to play with it at the head of her sleeping husband.\u201d Morgan cited testimony from an expert witness who stated it would take 7 pounds of pressure on the trigger in order for that gun to go off. \u201cDoes that pass your common sense?\n\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t an accident, ladies and gentlemen,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cIt was premeditated. It was calculated. She locks the door at 12:15 (p.m.), she closes the blinds after he\u2019s shot, and at 12:59 (p.m.) she unlocks the door. \u2026 Hold her responsible. Find her guilty.\u201d\n\nDefense: How many unanswered questions can you live with?\nWhile Theary\u2019s attorney, Chase Smith, waived opening remarks, he did not pass up on closing arguments. \u201cHow many unanswered questions can you have and still find someone guilty of premeditated first-degree murder?\u201d Chase Smith asked. \u201cMoral certainty is required, absolute certainty is not.\u201d\n\nSmith explained this means that when the trial is over and the jury is allowed to speak about the case, they need to be able to \u201cwithout hesitation\u201d explain why they found her guilty, why she shot him, why she did it intentionally, and why it was premeditated.\n\nHe pointed out what he called flaws in the state\u2019s case and with their witnesses. Smith mentioned a \u201cdrive-thru forensic test\u201d explaining that it took three years to get a test back on the gunshot residue kit from the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, a test that once it was started, only took one day to complete and get results. And he called the results confusing.\n\n\u201cAll the (GSR) was on her left hand, none on her right hand,\u201d Smith said before showing the same picture of Theary that the state published. \u201cThe picture the state put in, she has the gun in her right hand.\u201d Smith pulled out a form his client signed that waived her right to testify. \u201cShe signs that waiver with her right hand.\u201d\n\nSmith furthered his point by referencing the medical examiner report. Though the gun was close to the victims head, it wasn\u2019t close enough to leave a muzzle stamp, meaning there wasn\u2019t hard contact. \u201cNo pressure, no press down like you want to really kill somebody because you\u2019re mad.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t prove that she shot him,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWhat if he shot himself? What if one of the kids shot him? If you have a significant amount of unanswered questions, you\u2019ve got to ask yourselves, how many can you have and still be certain that she\u2019s guilty?\u201d Smith asked the jury.\n\nSentenced to life in prison\nTheary Lim was found guilty as charged of first-degree murder. After the jury was dismissed, a sentencing was immediately held.\n\nIn the state of Tennessee, if any individual is found guilty of first-degree murder, it is a mandatory life sentence (60 years). The only charge Theary was facing was the murder charge. Judge Robert Bateman imposed an immediate life sentence, minus credited time served up to 15%, for a minimum of 51 years in prison.",
                "What was the motive?  I have no problem holding her responsible for the death, but first degree murder and no established motive?",
                "reading the case. \n\nyeah it was on purpose.\n\ndo gun trigger some time fail .(many recalls on that) but if gun was used before said event.\n\nit would have been easy to spot or notice in the gun.",
                "It's been proven that most gun-related accidents are usually their own family members.\n\n\nHell, my older brother almost shot me once, I was staying with him and came home one night super late. He had his gun drawn on me, and I told him I came in through the front door and had keys and everything lol.\n\n\nAn intruder wouldn't enter that way, nor have keys.\n\n\nI feel like owning a gun makes people jumpy with it, like they *want* to use it on something to justify owning it.",

                "CLARKSVILLE, TN (CLARKSVILLE NOW) \u2013 After three days of testimony and only 1 hour and 20 minutes of jury deliberation, Theary Lim, charged with killing her Army veteran husband, was found guilty of first-degree murder on Wednesday and immediately sentenced to life in prison.\n\nOn Jan. 3, 2022, Clarksville Police conducted a welfare check in the 2200 block of Ladd Drive. Upon arrival, they found 38-year-old Sothon In dead from a gunshot wound to the head. Nearby, his wife, 32-year-old Theary Lim, and her two children were on the floor under a blanket. The next day, Theary Lim was arrested and charged.\n\nProsecution: \u2018This wasn\u2019t an accident, this was calculated\u2019\nDuring closing arguments, Assistant District Attorney Crystal Morgan displayed a professional photograph to the jury of Theary Lim holding a firearm, a leg holster secured to her thigh, and a T-shirt with the words \u201cGirls just want to have guns\u201d printed on the back.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the defendant\u2019s own statement to Detective (Keenan) Carlton: She admits she had the gun in her hands. She was playing with the gun, she shook it, and it went off,\u201d Morgan told the jury.\n\nMorgan referred to the medical examiner\u2019s testimony that the bullet entered through Sothon\u2019s forehead and exited out the back. She stated the defendant would had to have been standing beside the bed at close range, within 3 feet, when she fired the shot.\n\n\u201cShe left her husband in that bedroom for hours to die,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cA nine-hour and four-minute window that Sothon lay in that bedroom \u2013 with the defendant and his children in the house \u2013 dead.\n\n\u201cIt was an accident?\u201d Morgan said. \u201cWhat we have to believe to accept that statement is that she retrieved a gun, decided to play with it at the head of her sleeping husband.\u201d Morgan cited testimony from an expert witness who stated it would take 7 pounds of pressure on the trigger in order for that gun to go off. \u201cDoes that pass your common sense?\n\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t an accident, ladies and gentlemen,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cIt was premeditated. It was calculated. She locks the door at 12:15 (p.m.), she closes the blinds after he\u2019s shot, and at 12:59 (p.m.) she unlocks the door. \u2026 Hold her responsible. Find her guilty.\u201d\n\nDefense: How many unanswered questions can you live with?\nWhile Theary\u2019s attorney, Chase Smith, waived opening remarks, he did not pass up on closing arguments. \u201cHow many unanswered questions can you have and still find someone guilty of premeditated first-degree murder?\u201d Chase Smith asked. \u201cMoral certainty is required, absolute certainty is not.\u201d\n\nSmith explained this means that when the trial is over and the jury is allowed to speak about the case, they need to be able to \u201cwithout hesitation\u201d explain why they found her guilty, why she shot him, why she did it intentionally, and why it was premeditated.\n\nHe pointed out what he called flaws in the state\u2019s case and with their witnesses. Smith mentioned a \u201cdrive-thru forensic test\u201d explaining that it took three years to get a test back on the gunshot residue kit from the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, a test that once it was started, only took one day to complete and get results. And he called the results confusing.\n\n\u201cAll the (GSR) was on her left hand, none on her right hand,\u201d Smith said before showing the same picture of Theary that the state published. \u201cThe picture the state put in, she has the gun in her right hand.\u201d Smith pulled out a form his client signed that waived her right to testify. \u201cShe signs that waiver with her right hand.\u201d\n\nSmith furthered his point by referencing the medical examiner report. Though the gun was close to the victims head, it wasn\u2019t close enough to leave a muzzle stamp, meaning there wasn\u2019t hard contact. \u201cNo pressure, no press down like you want to really kill somebody because you\u2019re mad.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t prove that she shot him,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWhat if he shot himself? What if one of the kids shot him? If you have a significant amount of unanswered questions, you\u2019ve got to ask yourselves, how many can you have and still be certain that she\u2019s guilty?\u201d Smith asked the jury.\n\nSentenced to life in prison\nTheary Lim was found guilty as charged of first-degree murder. After the jury was dismissed, a sentencing was immediately held.\n\nIn the state of Tennessee, if any individual is found guilty of first-degree murder, it is a mandatory life sentence (60 years). The only charge Theary was facing was the murder charge. Judge Robert Bateman imposed an immediate life sentence, minus credited time served up to 15%, for a minimum of 51 years in prison.",
                "What was the motive?  I have no problem holding her responsible for the death, but first degree murder and no established motive?",
                "reading the case. \n\nyeah it was on purpose.\n\ndo gun trigger some time fail .(many recalls on that) but if gun was used before said event.\n\nit would have been easy to spot or notice in the gun.",
                "It's been proven that most gun-related accidents are usually their own family members.\n\n\nHell, my older brother almost shot me once, I was staying with him and came home one night super late. He had his gun drawn on me, and I told him I came in through the front door and had keys and everything lol.\n\n\nAn intruder wouldn't enter that way, nor have keys.\n\n\nI feel like owning a gun makes people jumpy with it, like they *want* to use it on something to justify owning it.",

What if one of the kids shot him? \n\nSounds like the prosecution failed to meet the burden of proof required for prove premeditation, but it\u2019s Tennessee\u2026."

                "OKLAHOMA CITY (KFOR) \u2014 A woman says her family\u2019s fresh start in Oklahoma turned into a nightmare after federal immigration agents raided their home, **taking their phones, laptops, and life savings** \u2013 even though they were not the suspects the agents were looking for.\n\nThe agents had a search warrant for the home, but **the suspects listed on the warrant do not live in the house**.\n\nThe woman who actually lives in the house had just moved to Oklahoma City from Maryland with her family about two weeks earlier..\n\n\"I said you took my phone. We have no money. I just moved here,\u201d the mother said. \u201cI have to feed my children. I\u2019m going to need gas money. I need to be able to get around. Like, how do you just leave me like this? Like an abandoned dog.\u201d\n\nShe said the agents ordered her and her daughters to step outside, even though it was raining and they barely were given time to put on clothes.\n\n\u201c**They wanted me to change in front of all of them, in between all of them**,\u201d she said. \u201cMy husband has not even seen my daughter in her undergarments \u2014 her own dad, because it\u2019s respectful. **You have her out there, a minor, in her underwear,**\u201d the woman told KFOR.\n\n\u201cOne of them said, \u2018I know it was a little rough this morning,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt was so denigrating. That you do all of this to a family, to women, your fellow citizens. And it was a little rough? You literally traumatized me and my daughters for life. We\u2019re going to have to go get help or get over this somehow.\u201d\n\nBefore the agents left, the mother asked when could the family get their belongings back and they said **it could be days or even months,** KFOR reported.\n\nEdit: Other news sources clarified that **20 men** broke into the house in the middle of the night while they were sleeping. So 20 men surrounded this woman and her three young daughters, dragged them out into the rain in their underwear, and made them change clothes in front of them. If there was any justice in this  country they would be up on charges of sexual exploitation of minors.\n\n2nd Edit: The ~~agents~~ stasi thugs wouldn't even leave a business card or phone number they could call to find out how to get their electronics and life savings back. The ~~agents~~ thieves refused to even tell them which government agency or department would be storing their property.",
