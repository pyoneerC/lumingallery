                ">\u201cSome will undoubtedly find today\u2019s decision unsatisfying, wondering why, if DOJ\u2019s ostensible reasons for dropping this case are so troubling, the Court does not simply deny the Motion to Dismiss altogether. But, as explained above, the Court cannot order DOJ to continue the prosecution, and it is aware of no authority (outside of the criminal contempt context) that would empower it, as some have urged, to appoint an independent prosecutor,\u201d Judge Ho wrote. \u201cTherefore, any decision by this Court to deny the Government\u2019s Motion to Dismiss would be futile at best, because DOJ could\u2014and, by all indications, unequivocally would\u2014simply refuse to prosecute the case, inevitably resulting in a dismissal after seventy days for violating the Mayor\u2019s right to a speedy trial. That route would simply postpone finality in this case to a date uncomfortably close to the June 24 mayoral primary. The public interest would not be served by such an outcome.\u201d\n\nSo basically the judge is saying, \u201cYes, the reasons DOJ wanted this dismissed are bad, but I can\u2019t force the prosecution to do their jobs, and if I dismiss with prejudice now they can\u2019t hold these charges over the head of an elected official to manipulate them.\u201d. These are the hard choices people have to make when the government has gone rogue and isn\u2019t interested in prosecuting someone who, by all accounts, very obviously took bribes from a foreign government.",

Now it's all for nothing because Trump's cronies wanted to engage in some boneheaded corruption scheme.  At least Adams can run against Cuomo scot-free in the mayoral race; here's to hoping they both lose."
