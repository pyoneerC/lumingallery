                "IMO the biggest miss with 23&Me is them not buying Ancestry.com, etc, to help build a collaborative genealogical chart system families could use and edit, or expanding on it with local family related news and documents available throughout the generations to better piece together familial history and even photos, etc.\n\nAside from selling biological info to ad companies or insurers or other seedy profiteers, I don\u2019t see why they couldn\u2019t have made money from a reduced priced option for current members / entrants to access the \u201cplus\u201d member benefits or used the genetic data and self reports, combined with localized double blind studies ofc, to confirm data trends that could be profitable while also not selling discreet information.\n\nI feel like they just didn\u2019t broaden the definition of what was possible under their company\u2019s umbrella.",
                "I am a former Regeneron employee (retired).  I can say they are not buying the failing business. They are buying the genetic database to use in the development of new monoclonal antibody therapeutic proteins.  There is an arms race to get to good candidates first to stake out patents to prevent competitors access to whole categories of potential therapies. They have lost several lawsuits to others who got there first metaphorically speaking.  They have technology to rapidly test candidates with Velocogene and could theoretically get dozens of billion dollar drugs from this dataset without any patent fights. The money spent is peanuts to its potential value.  While I am not a huge fan of the cost of these therapies , I personally know the tens to hundreds of thousands of man hours that go into developing these drugs, and they can be astonishingly effective.  It\u2019s not popular to say you worked in big pharma but I\u2019m very proud of the work I did there and how it has affected patients, including members of my own extended family.",

I actually found them, and now have a solid relationship with my full biological brother, which has been well worth any horrors that might occur from my DNA being in a database. Otherwise, I wouldn't do this.",
                "Ah, good thing it didn\u2019t get sold to an unscrupulous buyer that engages in securities fraud, price fixing, and has ties to the current administration. \n\nOh wait.  \n\nIf you haven\u2019t deleted your data from 23andMe, do it now.",
                "Ok, I guess I need to brace for the downvotes given the current comments here. \n\nHonestly, this is worlds better than an insurance company or some random tech startup with undescribed end goals, guys. This is a legitimate big pharmaceutical company who has a lot of R&D around genetic disease and has made a lot of therapeutic advances. They want the data to develop new therapies, probably ones for genetic based disease. Being the first to do this will make them so much money. That\u2019s their goal here, I think. It\u2019s new massively growing space in R&D. And this much genetic data is research treasure trove for them.\n\nThey are also going to have pre-designed protocols and standards when it comes to handling this data. I know people side eye big pharma (rightfully in most circumstances) but this is a much better outcome than many other situations.\n\nAm I saying don\u2019t delete your data? No. Am I saying this is better than pretty much any other potential buyer? Absolutely.\n\nI also want to add one thing: All the stuff about Trump ties is wild. Pretty much every pharma company (and  many of the academic researchers that Trump is now black listing from NIH funding due to their coronavirus research) got Project Warp Speed funding during the pandemic. Monoclonal antibody treatment was an absolute scientific miracle. So were the other rapid vaccine developments during the pandemic. It saved so many lives.",
                "Regeneron is the biggest company that created the monoclonal antibody treatment that was used as a post-infective treatment for COVID. Trump himself got it when he was infected. \n\nThey were also the recipient of close to half a billion in funding from Trump's Operation Warp Speed, the government-funded race to come up with vaccines and treatments for COVID.\n\nThe CEO and the company were treated quite preferentially by Ron DeSantis during the Biden years. \n\nSo we are talking strong ties to Trump and the GOP. It's not entirely out of the realm of possibility for them to sell the data inappropriately for unethical ends. Like HHS' contemplated autism DB. Thiel's Palantir. DOGE for whatever dystopic reason. ICE for a different dystopia. And of course, insurance companies."

Radar\u2010based debris signatures appeared before midnight, but the first *official* warnings for parts of the path weren\u2019t pushed until minutes after circulation was already on the ground.\n\n* **Why the gap matters** \u2013 For night-time storms you\u2019re asleep until a phone alert blares. Even a 5- to 10-minute lag can be the difference between getting to a basement and dying in bed.\n\n* **Staffing reality** \u2013 The Jackson, KY forecast office that covers Laurel County has been running 31 % below its authorised staffing since DOGE-mandated cuts early this year. The overnight forecaster position\u2014whose only job is to watch radar while everyone else sleeps\u2014was eliminated in April. Nearly half of NWS offices now have 20 %+ vacancy rates, according to an Associated Press analysis.\n\n* **Warnings on the night** \u2013 Because the office can\u2019t staff 24/7 anymore, an on-call meteorologist had to remote-log-in when rotation ramped up. That start-up window accounts for the delay you see in the warning logs.\n\n* **Experts warned this would happen** \u2013 Meteorologists and the employees\u2019 union flagged the risk in February; The NY Times, PBS, and WaPo all ran pieces in the past month on how the same budget axe was forcing eight forecast offices\u2014including Jackson\u2014to drop round-the-clock coverage.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nThe science isn\u2019t broken; the funding pipeline is. Cut the people who keep eyes on radar at 11 p.m. and you buy tragedy at midnight.",

They give critical live data as they ascend through the atmosphere. What does that tell us, why should I care what the wind speed or temperature is 18,000 feet up? \n\nBecause that feeds *directly* into weather models that are used to predict these kinds of events. \n\nSo they\u2019re *literally* making our forecasts harder and shittier.\n\nEdit: if you want to help the national weather service, you can look into volunteering to collect weather data through [CoCoRaHS](https://www.weather.gov/ilm/cocorahs).",

You want to have 3+ properties, long term rentals only for anything above your primary +1.\n\nI still use AIRBnB, but hotel pricing has come a long way in the past few years, where now it's a toss up if I look at Airbnb or hotels when I'm on vacation.  So it isn't even the savings it used to be which drove me to it in the first place.",

You want to have 3+ properties, long term rentals only for anything above your primary +1.\n\nI still use AIRBnB, but hotel pricing has come a long way in the past few years, where now it's a toss up if I look at Airbnb or hotels when I'm on vacation.  So it isn't even the savings it used to be which drove me to it in the first place.",
