He also agreed to restitution and forfeiture totaling nearly $580,000.",

[Santos sent emails to Senator Kevin McCarthy's wealthy donors claiming to be McCarthy's fundraiser. Santos siphoned money from McCarthy's campaign into his own](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/09/george-santos-raised-money-from-wealthy-gop-donors-while-lying-about-his-resume.html).\n\nThat was the last straw.
