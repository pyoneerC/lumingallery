                "I had one of the first 600 Tesla Model Ys. With taxes, etc., it came out to a pretty penny (north of $60k). It was a fun, engaging car and whoo boy that acceleration was bonkers.\n\nThen the reality set in. I kept trying to push through the inconveniences but damned if they didn\u2019t add up quickly. To whit:\n\n1.) A software update meant to improve the positional accuracy of the map bricked - get this - the A/C system. In the summer. It was literally a guessing game whether the A/C would turn on when I got in the car. Persisted for about 3 months before a patch was rolled out.\n\n2.) The vaunted heat pump quit twice, once in winter (as we were moving across the country). Only a threat of litigation got the service center to replace the unit. Replacing it took the service center nearly a week.\n\n3.) A simple windshield replacement was needed after a rock caused a crack that started spreading. I scheduled service (soonest I could get a spot was 4 weeks out) which got delayed an additional whole month because \u201cOur glass guy is sick,\u201d and yet another whole month because \u201cWe don\u2019t have glass.\u201d\n\n4.) At 4 years of ownership, it was found that elements of the sub-frame were developing soon-to-be catastrophic cracks. No, I didn\u2019t rally race it. Yes, I was religious about washing road salt off of it in wintertime. The upper control arm bushing was also \u201cshredded\u201d according to Firestone.\n\nAfter #4 happened, I drove to a dealership that literal same day and traded it in.",

                "I forgot who in particular said it, but some industry person once said that the best indicator of a downturn of a brand is to take a look at the resale numbers. So inventory rise, and how steep the asking price is. You get those two together - and it's not always merely a supply surge issue - there is something in the underlying that there is no recovering from. \n\nGranted, it would be by far in Tesla's own interest to dump Musk, but the problem won't go away until Musk divests entirely. It must be shown that Musk can not benefit from their own successes - especially one that funded Trump directly.",
