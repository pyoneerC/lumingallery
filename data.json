Thus tens of millions of people get different I information, news, facts, truths, etc than tens of millions of others. \n\nThat is the ONLY way you achieve what this nation has in the past decade. \n\nThirty years ago, Trump would have been laughed out of the 2015 primaries. \n\nBut after 30+ years (starting in the 1990s) of partisan based escalating Culture War for profit, by the time the \u201cage of information\u201d took hold half the country was just ready and waiting for an anti-lib media ecosystem. \n\nThey had Rush and Fox News and in the days before the World Wide Web was truly ubiquitous that was more than enough to make billions off culture war. But it wasn\u2019t enough to truly alter/diverge realities. The way information traveled was still \u201cslow\u201d. Outlets, regardless of lean were all still covering the same basic news stories. Average Americans may have had bias one way or the other, but they still all got more or less the same basic information from which to understand the world. \n\nBut that stopped being true once the flood gates of digital media opened, and they technology of targeted advertising became the number one business model in the digital age. \n\nThe barrier of entry was lowered so much that millions could start a blog, a community, or a \u201cnew media\u201d company. Better yet, there are nearly no rules to how you create and spread information online. Your voice, for free, can carry equal weight to a press outlet that has to pay researchers, editors, reporters, fact checkers, and journalists. Your voice can EARN as much as outlets that  have basic news gathering and reporting standards and practices. \n\nThere was never a version of this world where real news gathering/reporting and real journalism were ever going to survive in the face of millions of people who can just blast their opinions and hot takes. Especially when ad sales platforms do not care what those opinions and hot takes are. Especially when millions of people don\u2019t care if what they say is accurate, true, or even in good faith. \n\nAnd all of the above is BEFORE social media, with its engagement and personalization algos, and it\u2019s built in incentives to create and spread as much content as possible. \n\nWE\n\nARE\n\nBROKEN",

Dental health is overlooked so often in favor of extracirriculars. \"Sorry, Timmy has baseball practice so we need to reschedule/cancel.\" Ok, so Timmy is 7 years old, is a high caries risk, and hasn't seen us in 2 years.

They're a small child, they need your guidance. I am empathetic to a point but you have to do it. If they didn't want to shit in the toilet, would you let them do it outside too? \n\nI fear we are going to get a lot busier. \ud83e\udd7a\n\nEDIT:\n\nWow ok, did not expect my comment to blow up. I just want to let yall know that I feel you on multiple fronts. I have a background in dental assisting, veterinary dentistry,  medical and dental research but now I work in the admin side of dentistry (not a dentist), so the financial issues and insurance issues I deal with on a daily basis are frustrating and heart breaking. It was the same when I worked in veterinary. As much as I wish we could do this fully subsidized, the USA hates universal health care and we have to make money to feed our staff. A lot of dentists, including my own, are eschewing being in network with a lot of insurances because they pay literal pennies for procedures. I'm talking about 15-20 bucks for full surgical procedures, which with how much dental school costs...it's not economical. I highly suggest to find a dentist that has a membership plan, it is often more cost effective than dental premiums!\n\nAs for health, if you truly don't want to give your kid flouride, there are alternatives that are NOT charcoal (seriously, don't! especially if theyre on meds!). Boka has nano hydroxyapatite toothpaste that has been clinically studied and is a great alternative. But I must insist you get radiographs, as the tooth is like an iceburg. A lot goes on underneath the surface. \n\nDentistry shouldn't be a luxury. I myself have talked to my local representatives about health care and dental care being my top concern and how we are doing nothing about it. My state, CA, can do better and I want it to be better. I wish I had all the solutions, I wish everyone here can get care. But please, do not yell at the staff if insurance isn't covering procedures.

But it wasn\u2019t enough to truly alter/diverge realities. The way information traveled was still \u201cslow\u201d. Outlets, regardless of lean were all still covering the same basic news stories. Average Americans may have had bias one way or the other, but they still all got more or less the same basic information from which to understand the world. \n\nBut that stopped being true once the flood gates of digital media opened, and they technology of targeted advertising became the number one business model in the digital age. \n\nThe barrier of entry was lowered so much that millions could start a blog, a community, or a \u201cnew media\u201d company. Better yet, there are nearly no rules to how you create and spread information online. Your voice, for free, can carry equal weight to a press outlet that has to pay researchers, editors, reporters, fact checkers, and journalists. Your voice can EARN as much as outlets that  have basic news gathering and reporting standards and practices. \n\nThere was never a version of this world where real news gathering/reporting and real journalism were ever going to survive in the face of millions of people who can just blast their opinions and hot takes. Especially when ad sales platforms do not care what those opinions and hot takes are. Especially when millions of people don\u2019t care if what they say is accurate, true, or even in good faith. \n\nAnd all of the above is BEFORE social media, with its engagement and personalization algos, and it\u2019s built in incentives to create and spread as much content as possible. \n\nWE\n\nARE\n\nBROKEN",

Thus tens of millions of people get different I information, news, facts, truths, etc than tens of millions of others. \n\nThat is the ONLY way you achieve what this nation has in the past decade. \n\nThirty years ago, Trump would have been laughed out of the 2015 primaries. \n\nBut after 30+ years (starting in the 1990s) of partisan based escalating Culture War for profit, by the time the \u201cage of information\u201d took hold half the country was just ready and waiting for an anti-lib media ecosystem. \n\nThey had Rush and Fox News and in the days before the World Wide Web was truly ubiquitous that was more than enough to make billions off culture war. But it wasn\u2019t enough to truly alter/diverge realities. The way information traveled was still \u201cslow\u201d. Outlets, regardless of lean were all still covering the same basic news stories. Average Americans may have had bias one way or the other, but they still all got more or less the same basic information from which to understand the world. \n\nBut that stopped being true once the flood gates of digital media opened, and they technology of targeted advertising became the number one business model in the digital age. \n\nThe barrier of entry was lowered so much that millions could start a blog, a community, or a \u201cnew media\u201d company. Better yet, there are nearly no rules to how you create and spread information online. Your voice, for free, can carry equal weight to a press outlet that has to pay researchers, editors, reporters, fact checkers, and journalists. Your voice can EARN as much as outlets that  have basic news gathering and reporting standards and practices. \n\nThere was never a version of this world where real news gathering/reporting and real journalism were ever going to survive in the face of millions of people who can just blast their opinions and hot takes. Especially when ad sales platforms do not care what those opinions and hot takes are. Especially when millions of people don\u2019t care if what they say is accurate, true, or even in good faith. \n\nAnd all of the above is BEFORE social media, with its engagement and personalization algos, and it\u2019s built in incentives to create and spread as much content as possible. \n\nWE\n\nARE\n\nBROKEN",

The funniest part is that the door she let the man \u201cescape\u201d through led\u2026right back to the main hallway where officers were waiting lol\n\nSo basically they\u2019re going to argue either she didn\u2019t know how her own courthouse hallways work, or somehow she did know and it still counts as helping him \u201cescape\u201d by leading him straight back to them!\n\nEDIT: For people wanting to dispute what I say above, please watch [the Legal Eagle video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TPQeZalnArY&pp=0gcJCYsJAYcqIYzv) before doing so.",
