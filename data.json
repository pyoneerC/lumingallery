They are housed together in a single concrete cell with no natural light, fluorescent lights that are never turned off, no mats, no blankets, and limited bathroom facilities.\u201d\n\nCruel and unusual.",
                "\n#Canadian Woman Detained at US Border in Harrowing Ordeal\n\nA British Columbia woman has found herself trapped in a nightmare after being unexpectedly detained at the US border and transferred to an Arizona detention centre under conditions her family describes as inhumane.\n\nJasmine Mooney, a 35-year-old businesswoman from Abbotsford, was attempting to enter the United States through the San Ysidro border crossing between Mexico and San Diego on 3 March. She had hoped to apply for a Trade NAFTA (TN) work visa, but her paperwork was incomplete. Instead of being turned away or allowed to rectify the issue, she was arrested by US border officers and placed in detention.\n\nWhat followed has left her mother, Alexis Eagles, desperate for answers. After three nights at a San Diego detention centre, Mooney was handed over to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. For a brief moment, her family thought she had been released when an online tracking system marked her as free. Then she vanished.\n\nPanic set in when hours turned into a full day with no word from her. Eventually, the family learned that Mooney and around thirty others had been pulled from their cells in the middle of the night and transported to the San Luis Detention Center in Arizona. There, according to reports from inside, she has been crammed into a concrete cell with no natural light, harsh fluorescent bulbs that never switch off, no proper bedding and limited bathroom facilities.\n\nMooney has not been charged with any crime. She has no criminal record. She has simply been caught in a bureaucratic nightmare that has left her in chains, awaiting a resolution that remains unclear.\n\nHer mother is not disputing the right of US authorities to refuse Mooney entry. She does, however, take issue with the treatment her daughter is enduring. Mooney herself, in text messages to a business partner, described the conditions as \"inhumane.\" The women in detention are sleeping on mats, the food is barely edible, and the lights make proper rest impossible. Despite the circumstances, Mooney has tried to stay strong, telling her friend that she is in a better position than others and must keep going.\n\nMooney is no stranger to hard work. She built a career in Vancouver\u2019s hospitality industry after moving there from the Yukon in 2008, later expanding into the health and wellness sector. Her most recent work had her involved in Los Angeles, where she had previously been granted a TN work visa. That visa was revoked in November last year when she attempted to return to the US after a vacation. This time, hoping to secure another visa, she took the route that had worked for her before, crossing from Mexico. It was a decision that led to an ordeal beyond anything she could have imagined.\n\nHer business partner, BJ McCaslin, has been in touch with her through a prison communication app and is deeply concerned. He does not understand why she remains detained when there is no evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nGlobal Affairs Canada has acknowledged Mooney's detention and confirmed that consular officials are in contact with US authorities. Beyond that, they say little can be done. While governments may express concern, they rarely intervene when another country enforces its own immigration rules.\n\nThat leaves Mooney and her family in an agonising state of limbo. They are not asking for special treatment, only basic human decency. For now, all they can do is wait, and hope that her ordeal does not stretch on indefinitely.",

She didn't know and asked scholarship coordinator II who didn't know and asked some other donor coordinator to get an answer. \n\nAnother time I had to shoot a question about rural housing on an away rotation from housing coordinator, to south west housing coordinator, to the rotation site's housing coordinator. I was one of 2 students that month in that town. We have our own on campus housing coordinator. \n\nFurther our dual degree coordinator was doing a bad job that both students and the co-directors complained multiple times. The Dean said they couldn't fire her. Only wait for someone to retire to move her over to something else. Took 2 years. It's weird. \n\nMedical schools struggle to find ways to deal with stricter budgets and will cut things like research and journal club food and out of town speakers and lab resources....but loooove admin bloat for whatever reason",

This is like if the accounting department called the engineering department and started laying people off.  When they don't have that power - their job is to check the numbers and pay the bills.  HR has the power to lay someone off **as directed by the department with that ability**.\n\nAll along, DOGE has been showing up, declaring they have the power to fire people, cancel contracts, and halt spending - but they can't seem to show where Congress authorized them.\n\n> The judge slammed the attorney representing the Justice Department for refusing to make OPM Acting Director Charles Ezell available for cross-examination and for withdrawing his sworn declaration, which the judge called a \"sham.\"\n\nRight.  Because in the end - they **don't** have that power, and they've been acting like they do.  And now that people are pulling back the sheet and saying \"Hey - who is this ketamine burned out weirdo behind the curtain - they're a humbug!\" we see this is just a coup by another name.\n\nIt's not about saving money.  It's about executive outreach masquerading as \"fixing problems\" when it's really taking Congress's power to decide where money is spent and saying \"No - I don't like that law so I'll just ignore it.  Oh - and find money to pay for Starlink contracts, and let's get rid of the people investigating why the fuck Space X rockets are allowed to blow up and reroute flights and threaten people's lives.\"",
