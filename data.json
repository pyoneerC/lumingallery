                "So thankful someone found her in time. Something similar happened to my coworker\u2019s husband some years ago. They were relocating to a new state for a job. Husband was the last to travel alone after closing up the old house. He was driving through a mountainous area and veered off the road. His car landed in a very wooded area many feet below the highway and not visible. He was pinned hanging upside down and could not get down or out of the car. Couldn\u2019t reach the phone and the battery eventually died. Authorities were reluctant to do deep search because he had not been missing 24 hours. They said he could have stopped off to eat or rest. She reached out to friends and family and anyone who would help. They were able to narrow down the search area on the basis of his last conversation with his wife. The only reason they finally found him was a bright red dolly fell out of his truck during the accident and the handle was sticking out of a visible area. This is why you should always let someone know of your travel plans and check in once in a while and keep your phone charged.",

The finding is the lynchpin for the agency\u2019s regulations about greenhouse gas pollution under the Clean Air Act.\u00a0",

I feel like every few months we get an article that says with high confidence that it came from bats or from a lab. Of course the complete opacity of the Chinese government doesn\u2019t help with this at all. \n\nIt\u2019s also important to remember that we may not have the answer for some time.

                "So thankful someone found her in time. Something similar happened to my coworker\u2019s husband some years ago. They were relocating to a new state for a job. Husband was the last to travel alone after closing up the old house. He was driving through a mountainous area and veered off the road. His car landed in a very wooded area many feet below the highway and not visible. He was pinned hanging upside down and could not get down or out of the car. Couldn\u2019t reach the phone and the battery eventually died. Authorities were reluctant to do deep search because he had not been missing 24 hours. They said he could have stopped off to eat or rest. She reached out to friends and family and anyone who would help. They were able to narrow down the search area on the basis of his last conversation with his wife. The only reason they finally found him was a bright red dolly fell out of his truck during the accident and the handle was sticking out of a visible area. This is why you should always let someone know of your travel plans and check in once in a while and keep your phone charged.",

This information is from 2020, and I swear I remember reading another article in nature with more recent information saying that it came from bats based on genomic data. I\u2019m curious what kind of information the German secret service has for them to be 80-90% sure it\u2019s a lab leak, because that\u2019s\u2026pretty damn high, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s as much reason to distrust the German government TBH, but how does that jive with the genomic data? \n\nI hate how political this has become because obviously it\u2019s important to know where it came from in order to prevent future outbreaks. I feel like every few months we get an article that says with high confidence that it came from bats or from a lab. Of course the complete opacity of the Chinese government doesn\u2019t help with this at all. \n\nIt\u2019s also important to remember that we may not have the answer for some time. For example we still don\u2019t know the specific source of Ebola even though it was first discovered over 40 years ago.",
                "I still think that \u201cinvestigations\u201d that claim it\u2019s a lab leak are more concerned with politics than actually determining the source of the virus and how the reduce the possibility of another virus mutating and becoming a worldwide pandemic (essentially inevitable now).",
