And once pens are obtained, the forms can be filled out in proper triplicate, to be separated and filed in their widespread destinations. \n\nUn-American orders need not be expedited; they should be completed with \"all deliberate speed\".

                "#Tear Gas and Turmoil as Turkey Rises for Justice\n\nThe streets of Istanbul have been lit up not by celebration but by the fierce glow of protest as thousands rally for justice following the arrest of the city\u2019s mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu. For four nights running, crowds have surged across Turkey\u2019s major cities, marking the country\u2019s largest wave of demonstrations in over a decade. What began with a few scattered gatherings has now grown into a roar of resistance.\n\nImamoglu, long seen as a serious rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, was taken into custody on Wednesday, just days before his party was expected to confirm him as their presidential candidate for 2028. Accused of corruption and aiding terrorist groups, charges he flatly denies, his arrest has shaken the political landscape and drawn thousands into the streets demanding his release.\n\nOn Saturday, he appeared in court, his supporters chanting \"rights, law, justice\" outside as tear gas swirled in the cold night air. Riot police stood shoulder to shoulder, firing round after round to break up the crowds, but still they came. Mothers holding their children, students in masks, pensioners waving flags, all united by a shared belief that something fundamental is slipping away.\n\n\"I'm here for liberty,\" one young woman told the BBC, her face hidden behind a mask. \"Turkish people cannot accept this. This is against our behaviour and culture.\" Her words echoed the mood across Istanbul, where the government has banned public gatherings in a bid to quell the unrest. But the ban only seems to have poured fuel on the fire.\n\nIn Izmir and Ankara, the story was much the same. Water cannons, arrests, more tear gas. On Friday alone, 343 people were reportedly detained. Still, the crowds held their ground, shouting not in anger but in defiance, determined to be heard. There is an unmistakable feeling that this is no longer just about one man, but about the future of democracy itself in Turkey.\n\nImamoglu\u2019s bid for the presidency now hangs in the balance. Just a day before his arrest, Istanbul University stripped him of his degree, citing irregularities. If upheld, this would disqualify him from running, as Turkish law requires a university qualification for presidential candidates. The timing has raised eyebrows across the political spectrum.\n\nPresident Erdogan, who has ruled the country for over two decades, cannot stand again in 2028 unless the constitution is changed. Critics argue that the arrests of Imamoglu and more than a hundred others, including journalists and business figures, are an attempt to clear the political field before the next election. The government, for its part, insists the judiciary is acting independently and has hit out at those suggesting otherwise.\n\nWhether or not that claim holds weight, what is clear is that a growing number of Turkish citizens feel they are being silenced. The sheer courage of those risking arrest to march night after night speaks volumes. These protests are no longer just about one politician behind bars. They are about the soul of a nation, and the kind of future its people are willing to fight for."

                "> He directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to review the conduct of lawyers and law firms the administration considers to have filed frivolous lawsuits against the Trump administration or attempted to block immigration initiatives, broadening the president\u2019s crackdown on the US legal community in the United States. \n\nThis is a whole article in its own right, tacked on the end there. \n\n[Trump ordered the attorney general to report 'frivolous' lawsuits against his administration so he can consider executive actions against firms. Read the memo.](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-attorney-general-memo-identify-target-law-firms-2025-3)",

                "Like, imagine if Obama did this to Bush Jr? Ohh wait, you can't because it's only something a petty immature asshole would do, right, and a US president would have enough self dignity to not act like a child, so you would think. \n\nI'm sure they can attempt to sue to get it back since the clearances weren't revoked for anything meaningful, it seems, but I'm not sure how that would work or if there is any legal recourse available.",
                "Some of them did not even have security clearance anymore. This was mostly performative.\n\nKinzinger made a post to his substack about it.",
                "Now the president has the power to determine the legitimacy of lawsuits.\n\nNo authoritarian conduct here.  No Imperial Presidency to see folks. Move along or you'll be in prison in El salvador.",
