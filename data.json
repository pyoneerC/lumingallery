They have lost several lawsuits to others who got there first metaphorically speaking.  They have technology to rapidly test candidates with Velocogene and could theoretically get dozens of billion dollar drugs from this dataset without any patent fights. The money spent is peanuts to its potential value.  While I am not a huge fan of the cost of these therapies , I personally know the tens to hundreds of thousands of man hours that go into developing these drugs, and they can be astonishingly effective.

This is a legitimate big pharmaceutical company who has a lot of R&D around genetic disease and has made a lot of therapeutic advances. They want the data to develop new therapies, probably ones for genetic based disease. Being the first to do this will make them so much money. That\u2019s their goal here, I think. It\u2019s new massively growing space in R&D. And this much genetic data is research treasure trove for them.\n\nThey are also going to have pre-designed protocols and standards when it comes to handling this data. I know people side eye big pharma (rightfully in most circumstances) but this is a much better outcome than many other situations.\n\nAm I saying don\u2019t delete your data? No. Am I saying this is better than pretty much any other potential buyer? Absolutely.\n\nI also want to add one thing: All the stuff about Trump ties is wild. Pretty much every pharma company (and  many of the academic researchers that Trump is now black listing from NIH funding due to their coronavirus research) got Project Warp Speed funding during the pandemic. Monoclonal antibody treatment was an absolute scientific miracle. So were the other rapid vaccine developments during the pandemic. It saved so many lives.",

I\u2019d start strategizing a show to run on Sunday at 7 to start picking them off. Disney, in particular, has been leading the other two in the nightly news slot for a while with World News Tonight. It\u2019s a golden opportunity to lock CBS out of news ratings forever. It\u2019s amazing that the Tiffany network, with its prestigious history of news by the way of Murrow, Cronkite, and Couric, has let their news department become second rate at best. You can even see, Face the Nation is second tier compared to Meet the Press and This Week. It\u2019s a weaker program than CNNs Sunday Show, and is now more parred up with Fox\u2019s Sunday show. 60 minutes and Sunday Morning, were kinda the two last news shows that carried any prestige within the network. It\u2019s so far from being the Tiffany network they used to be lauded as."

You want to have 3+ properties, long term rentals only for anything above your primary +1.\n\nI still use AIRBnB, but hotel pricing has come a long way in the past few years, where now it's a toss up if I look at Airbnb or hotels when I'm on vacation.  So it isn't even the savings it used to be which drove me to it in the first place.",
