                "The son of a local sheriff's deputy allegedly opened fire near the Student Union at Florida State University in Tallahassee on Thursday, killing two people and injuring six others, authorities said.\n\nThe suspect -- 20-year-old Phoenix Ikner, a current FSU student -- was shot by responders and has been hospitalized, police said. He was taken into custody with non-life-threatening injuries, multiple law enforcement officials told ABC News.\n\nIkner is the son of a current Leon County sheriff's deputy, according to Sheriff Walter McNeil. He had access to one of his mother's personal weapons, which was one of the weapons found at the scene, the sheriff said. It appeared Ikner had a handgun and a shotgun with him, police said.\n\nThe suspect's mother has been a deputy with the department for more than 18 years and \"her service to this community has been exceptional,\" McNeil said.\n\nThe suspect was also a \"long-standing member\" of the Leon County Sheriff's Office's Youth Advisory Council, McNeil said.\n\nHe was \"engaged in a number of training programs that we have,\" the sheriff said, adding, \"Not a surprise to us that he had access to weapons.\"...",
                "So will he be called a domestic-terrorist because of his previous statements made towards people of a certain political party?  \n\n  \nSurely they will come down hard on him right?",
                ">The suspect was also a \"long-standing member\" of the Leon County Sheriff's Office's Youth Advisory Council, McNeil said.\n\nIt seems like Leon County Sheriff's Office's is directly working under the satan's guidance.",
