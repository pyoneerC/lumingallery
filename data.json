                ">The diet company formerly known as WeightWatchers has filed for bankruptcy after its 62-year-old business model was put under strain by the rise of weight-loss drugs such as Ozempic.\n\n[Ozempic users are also spending less on groceries.](https://progressivegrocer.com/do-weight-loss-drugs-lead-grocery-sales-losses) There's plenty of industries taking a hit because of weight loss drugs. No surprise restaurant chains are also filing bankruptcy.",
                "My view is: Any organization that is meant to solve a problem should have a goal to put itself out of business. For example, I volunteer for organizations that promote organ donation. They know that as soon as permanent solutions are developed, their mission is fulfilled.\n\nHowever, is Ozempic/etc. the correct answer? Maybe, maybe not for a multitude of reasons. If it is not, then an organization such as Weight Watchers is still theoretically needed.",

                "I'm no expert, but I feel like this was the straw that broke the camel's back, but I think the Internet also has made programs like Weight Watchers a lot less effective. Why pay for what is essentially glorified advice on how to eat healthy when you can find 1000 tiktok nutritonist who are legitimate and give much more nuanced nutrition advice. \n\nBack in the 90's it made sense, the Internet was far more niche, and nutritonists were expensive, you couldn't reliably find dieting tips that were effective. \n\nNow you can't take 10 steps without tripping over some actually legitimately good nutritonists. People who are realistic and don't have this expectation that every person is going to eat nothing but grilled chicken, fruit, and salad for every meal. People who know you are going to cheat and give you ways to minimize the harm a cheat day does. \n\nAs a frame of reference, I lost over 100 lbs last year just from diet changes (and a bit of exercise, but mostly diet), I did very little research, I just started off by cutting out obviously bad things (fried foods, processed red meats), and then just randomly saw quite a few accounts that gave good advice on effective fast food orders. Like legitimate realistic advice that made it a lot easier to stay consistent.",

Of course, the word \"drug\" when dealing with excess weight, inspires me even less.",
                "As someone who used Weight Watchers several times, this is not surprising for a very big reason: They have no real identity as a company anymore. For a long time it was a regular point system, and then transferred to several, and then they were Points Plus, and then they were color coded as blue/green/purple plans depending on your goals, and then came the zero point foods...\n\n\nMy point being that there was no real core identity to focus on. There was no real \"winning\" solution they could market because they kept changing the fundamentals and principles of the program. Yes, it centered around points, but they constantly changed the \"rules\" of the program with no real evidence to back up why. It just seems like they did it to appease people who didn't want to be diligent in counting points for this or that. It's tough to count calories, they saw the breakthrough by taking big numbers out of it, but they just had no allegiance to their core methods.\n\n\nSo yes, Ozempic and other drugs might have put a damper on things, but they were losing popularity before withing communities I'm in anyway.",
                "Weight Watchers started out as a support group. It was really simple. I don\u2019t even think it was a business.    \n\nBut it got taken over by people trying to monetize it, and by the time I walked into one of their offices, they were selling snacks. Highly processed low-fat snacks.",
                "This is because... IT DID NOT WORK. WeightWatchers has been selling a false promise for 62-years and it finally caught up with them. End of story.",
                "I used WW several times in the past. Key word - several. Which means I didn\u2019t sustain the losses.\n\nI bet many people who spent their lives doing WW over and over again (and there were mostly older women at meetings who attended for decades and not because of maintenance) likely also realized the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome. And then came Ozempic for the final death knell.\n\nI mean, I\u2019m losing weight just by eating more whole and fresh foods and regularly exercising, and I use a regular, cheaper food tracking app to make sure my portions are okay. I don\u2019t need WW for this, and it\u2019s much easier to stick to than WW anyway."
