                "*Article Text:*\n\nLONDON \u2014 A lettercard penned by one of the Titanic\u2019s most well-known survivors from onboard the ship, days before it sank, has sold for 300,000 pounds ($399,000) at auction.\n\nIn the note, written to the seller\u2019s great-uncle on April 10, 1912, first-class passenger Archibald Gracie wrote of the ill-fated steamship: \u201cIt is a fine ship but I shall await my journeys end before I pass judgment on her.\u201d\n\nThe letter was sold to a private collector from the United States on Saturday, according to auction house Henry Aldridge & Son in Wiltshire, England. The hammer price far exceeded the initial estimate price of 60,000 pounds.\n\nThe letter is believed to be the sole example in existence from Gracie from onboard the Titanic, which sank off Newfoundland after hitting an iceberg, killing about 1,500 people on its maiden voyage.\n\nAuctioneer Andrew Aldridge described it as an \u201cexceptional museum grade piece.\u201d\n\nGracie, who jumped from the ship and managed to scramble onto an overturned collapsible boat, was rescued by other passengers onboard a lifeboat and was taken to the R.M.S. Carpathia. He went on to write \u201cThe Truth about the Titanic,\u201d an account of his experiences, when he returned to New York City.\n\nGracie boarded the Titanic in Southampton on April 10, 1912, and was assigned first-class cabin C51. His book is seen as one of the most detailed accounts of the events of the night the ship sank, Aldridge said. Gracie did not fully recover from the hypothermia he suffered, and died of complications from diabetes in late 1912.\n\nThe letter was postmarked Queenstown, Ireland, one of two stops the Titanic made before sinking.",

He joined Rainbow Family, a leftwing environmental protest group, and in 2023 traveled to Hatay, Turkey, to assist in the recovery following the earthquake that killed more than 56,000 people. He had also become increasingly angry at the US for its support of Israel and the war in Gaza.\n\n> While in Turkey, Gloss began expressing a desire to go on to Russia. \u201cHe was usually watching videos about Palestine and was so angry at America,\u201d one acquaintance told iStories. \u201cHe started thinking about going to Russia. He wanted to war with the USA. But I think he was very influenced by the conspiracy theory videos.\u201d\n\nAnother lost soul who tossed his life away after going down the rabbit hole of these batshit conspiracy videos\u2026"
