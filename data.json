                "*Article Excerpt from Jackie Wattles (CNN):*\n\nA Soviet-era spacecraft that was designed to make a soft landing on Venus \u2014 but instead remained trapped in Earth orbit for decades \u2014 is slated to fall from the sky Friday night or early Saturday, according to the latest estimates from experts.\n\nThe object, referred to as Cosmos 482 or Kosmos 482, is believed to be a capsule launched by the Soviet Union in March 1972 that failed en route to a transfer orbit that would have taken it to Venus to study its environment.\n\nIn the decades since, the object has circled Earth aimlessly as it was slowly dragged back toward home.\n\nAstronomers and space traffic experts have had their eyes on the object for years now as its orbital path has slowly reached lower and lower altitudes, a result of the subtle atmospheric drag that exists even hundreds of miles away from Earth.\n\nThe cylinder-shaped craft, which is about 3 feet (1 meter) in diameter, is now predicted to crash back to Earth overnight. Cosmos 482 is on track to hit the ground or ocean roughly between 10 p.m. and 6:30 a.m. ET, according to four analyses of the object from various institutions, including the European Space Agency and the federally funded US research group Aerospace Corporation.\n\nThat guidance is still in line with predictions issued by space traffic experts earlier this week. The estimated time frame of the vehicle\u2019s final descent will narrow as the event approaches.\n\nBecause of the sheer complexity of spaceflight and unpredictable factors, such as space weather, it can be extremely difficult to pinpoint exactly when or where an object will fall out of orbit.\n\nThis particular piece of space junk likely won\u2019t pose a risk to people on the ground.\n\n\u201cThis object was designed to survive reentering Venus, so there\u2019s fair odds that it\u2019ll survive coming back (to Earth) in one piece,\u201d said Marlon Sorge, a space debris expert with The Aerospace Corporation, on Monday. \u201cThat actually makes the risk less \u2026 because it would stay intact.\u201d",
                "from the article:\n\u201cWhat to do if you spot debris:\n\nWhile a landing on dry ground is unlikely, it\u2019s not impossible. The Cosmos 482 object\u2019s trajectory shows it could hit anywhere within a broad swath of land that includes \u201cthe whole of Africa, South America, Australia, the USA, parts of Canada, parts of Europe, and parts of Asia,\u201d said Marco Langbroek, a lecturer and space traffic expert at Delft Technical University in the Netherlands, via email.\n\nSorge emphasized that if Cosmos 482 hits the ground after its final descent tonight, onlookers are advised to keep their distance.

The US does have some other processing capabilities, but its mostly the Aussies with the know-how (I guess it involves using shitty beer to do it? j/k). \n\nBear in mind that if its processed abroad thats 2 x shipping costs, plus hazards materials handling, plus a tariff.\n\nSo that $1.8Bln plant, even if its a smaller facility, will be really useful!
