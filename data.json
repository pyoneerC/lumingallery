                "*Article Excerpt from Jackie Wattles (CNN):*\n\nA Soviet-era spacecraft that was designed to make a soft landing on Venus \u2014 but instead remained trapped in Earth orbit for decades \u2014 is slated to fall from the sky Friday night or early Saturday, according to the latest estimates from experts.\n\nThe object, referred to as Cosmos 482 or Kosmos 482, is believed to be a capsule launched by the Soviet Union in March 1972 that failed en route to a transfer orbit that would have taken it to Venus to study its environment.\n\nIn the decades since, the object has circled Earth aimlessly as it was slowly dragged back toward home.\n\nAstronomers and space traffic experts have had their eyes on the object for years now as its orbital path has slowly reached lower and lower altitudes, a result of the subtle atmospheric drag that exists even hundreds of miles away from Earth.\n\nThe cylinder-shaped craft, which is about 3 feet (1 meter) in diameter, is now predicted to crash back to Earth overnight. Cosmos 482 is on track to hit the ground or ocean roughly between 10 p.m. and 6:30 a.m. ET, according to four analyses of the object from various institutions, including the European Space Agency and the federally funded US research group Aerospace Corporation.\n\nThat guidance is still in line with predictions issued by space traffic experts earlier this week. The estimated time frame of the vehicle\u2019s final descent will narrow as the event approaches.\n\nBecause of the sheer complexity of spaceflight and unpredictable factors, such as space weather, it can be extremely difficult to pinpoint exactly when or where an object will fall out of orbit.\n\nThis particular piece of space junk likely won\u2019t pose a risk to people on the ground.\n\n\u201cThis object was designed to survive reentering Venus, so there\u2019s fair odds that it\u2019ll survive coming back (to Earth) in one piece,\u201d said Marlon Sorge, a space debris expert with The Aerospace Corporation, on Monday. \u201cThat actually makes the risk less \u2026 because it would stay intact.\u201d",
                "from the article:\n\u201cWhat to do if you spot debris:\n\nWhile a landing on dry ground is unlikely, it\u2019s not impossible. The Cosmos 482 object\u2019s trajectory shows it could hit anywhere within a broad swath of land that includes \u201cthe whole of Africa, South America, Australia, the USA, parts of Canada, parts of Europe, and parts of Asia,\u201d said Marco Langbroek, a lecturer and space traffic expert at Delft Technical University in the Netherlands, via email.\n\nSorge emphasized that if Cosmos 482 hits the ground after its final descent tonight, onlookers are advised to keep their distance. The aged spacecraft could leak dangerous fuels or pose other risks to people and property.\n\u201cContact the authorities,\u201d Sorge urged. \u201cPlease don\u2019t mess with it.\u201d",
                "Isn't this what caused the zombie outbreak in the original \"Night of the Living Dead?\"",
                "So in summary a 3 foot long piece of invincible space debris traveling at terminal velocity will land somewhere in \u201cthe whole of Africa, South America, Australia, the USA, parts of Canada, parts of Europe, and parts of Asia\u201d or the ocean. Cool, cool. That is completely unconcerning except for the random ball of death that could kill anyone or no one sometime in the next day or so.",
                ">This particular piece of space junk likely won\u2019t pose a risk to people on the ground\n\nLike, rationally I get that the odds of it hitting anything of significance are low, but on the off chance that some poor bastard gets nailed by a 3-foot metal dildo going Mach fuck\u2026",

                ">A lawsuit filed in federal court is seeking to undo the 624,000-acre Chuckwalla National Monument in the Southern California desert, claiming President Biden overstepped his authority by setting aside such a vast swath of land days before leaving office.\n\n>Plaintiffs represented by an Austin, Texas-based conservative think tank claim Biden abused the Antiquities Act, a 1906 law that allows presidents to create national monuments. The suit brought against the Interior Department highlights that the law mandates monuments be limited to the \u201csmallest area compatible with proper care and management of the objects to be protected.\u201d\n\n>\u201cIf you look at the history, it was supposed to be limited to, let\u2019s say, 100 acres, maybe 1,000 acres. But it certainly wasn\u2019t the kind of expansion that we\u2019ve seen in recent years,\u201d said Matt Miller, senior attorney for the Texas Public Policy Foundation, which filed the suit.\n\n>Supporters of Chuckwalla, which sits south of Joshua Tree National Park, point out that the law has long been used by presidents to protect large land masses \u2014 including the designation of the Grand Canyon by Theodore Roosevelt in 1908. On Jan. 14,[ Biden created Chuckwall](https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-01-14/biden-creates-two-national-monuments-in-california-chuckwalla-sattitla-highlands)a to safeguard land sacred to tribes as well as important wildlife habitat and military sites.\n\n>On May 1, the foundation [filed the suit](https://www.texaspolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Chuckwalla-Case-Complaint-Torongo-v.-Burgum.pdf) against the U.S. Department of the Interior in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan on behalf of a resident of the state with mining claims in the footprint of the monument and the BlueRibbon Coalition, a nonprofit that advocates for recreation access.\n\n>According to the lawsuit, Daniel Torongo, whose family began mining in the region in 1978, and members of the BlueRibbon Coalition, will be prevented from using the land in ways they previously enjoyed because of the monument designation.\n\n>Torongo, of Brighton, Mich., will face onerous restrictions to maintaining his claim and will not be able to expand it as he planned, potentially threatening his retirement plan to spend more time mining there with his family, according to the suit.\n\n>\u201cAlthough Mr. Torongo and his family have invested time and money in acquiring claims, equipment and relevant knowledge, the dream of expanding their operation beyond its current size is no longer possible,\u201d the suit states.\n\n>BlueRibbon Coalition members, meanwhile, which include off-roaders and dirt bikers, fear they\u2019ll also face restrictions because of the \u201cgoal of maintaining the undeveloped character of the land,\u201d according to the suit.\n\n>The Interior Department hasn\u2019t yet responded to the suit and spokeswoman J. Elizabeth Peace said department policy is not to comment on litigation.\n\nApparently the miners, off-roaders and dirtbikers feel the designation is infringing on their enjoyment of these beautiful lands, and they have people with deep pockets working to overturn it.",

                "*Article Excerpt from Jackie Wattles (CNN):*\n\nA Soviet-era spacecraft that was designed to make a soft landing on Venus \u2014 but instead remained trapped in Earth orbit for decades \u2014 is slated to fall from the sky Friday night or early Saturday, according to the latest estimates from experts.\n\nThe object, referred to as Cosmos 482 or Kosmos 482, is believed to be a capsule launched by the Soviet Union in March 1972 that failed en route to a transfer orbit that would have taken it to Venus to study its environment.\n\nIn the decades since, the object has circled Earth aimlessly as it was slowly dragged back toward home.\n\nAstronomers and space traffic experts have had their eyes on the object for years now as its orbital path has slowly reached lower and lower altitudes, a result of the subtle atmospheric drag that exists even hundreds of miles away from Earth.\n\nThe cylinder-shaped craft, which is about 3 feet (1 meter) in diameter, is now predicted to crash back to Earth overnight. Cosmos 482 is on track to hit the ground or ocean roughly between 10 p.m. and 6:30 a.m. ET, according to four analyses of the object from various institutions, including the European Space Agency and the federally funded US research group Aerospace Corporation.\n\nThat guidance is still in line with predictions issued by space traffic experts earlier this week. The estimated time frame of the vehicle\u2019s final descent will narrow as the event approaches.\n\nBecause of the sheer complexity of spaceflight and unpredictable factors, such as space weather, it can be extremely difficult to pinpoint exactly when or where an object will fall out of orbit.\n\nThis particular piece of space junk likely won\u2019t pose a risk to people on the ground.\n\n\u201cThis object was designed to survive reentering Venus, so there\u2019s fair odds that it\u2019ll survive coming back (to Earth) in one piece,\u201d said Marlon Sorge, a space debris expert with The Aerospace Corporation, on Monday. \u201cThat actually makes the risk less \u2026 because it would stay intact.\u201d",
                "from the article:\n\u201cWhat to do if you spot debris:\n\nWhile a landing on dry ground is unlikely, it\u2019s not impossible. The Cosmos 482 object\u2019s trajectory shows it could hit anywhere within a broad swath of land that includes \u201cthe whole of Africa, South America, Australia, the USA, parts of Canada, parts of Europe, and parts of Asia,\u201d said Marco Langbroek, a lecturer and space traffic expert at Delft Technical University in the Netherlands, via email.\n\nSorge emphasized that if Cosmos 482 hits the ground after its final descent tonight, onlookers are advised to keep their distance. The aged spacecraft could leak dangerous fuels or pose other risks to people and property.\n\u201cContact the authorities,\u201d Sorge urged. \u201cPlease don\u2019t mess with it.\u201d",

On Jan. 14,[ Biden created Chuckwall](https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-01-14/biden-creates-two-national-monuments-in-california-chuckwalla-sattitla-highlands)a to safeguard land sacred to tribes as well as important wildlife habitat and military sites.\n\n>On May 1, the foundation [filed the suit](https://www.texaspolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Chuckwalla-Case-Complaint-Torongo-v.-Burgum.pdf) against the U.S. Department of the Interior in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan on behalf of a resident of the state with mining claims in the footprint of the monument and the BlueRibbon Coalition, a nonprofit that advocates for recreation access.\n\n>According to the lawsuit, Daniel Torongo, whose family began mining in the region in 1978, and members of the BlueRibbon Coalition, will be prevented from using the land in ways they previously enjoyed because of the monument designation.\n\n>Torongo, of Brighton, Mich., will face onerous restrictions to maintaining his claim and will not be able to expand it as he planned, potentially threatening his retirement plan to spend more time mining there with his family, according to the suit.\n\n>\u201cAlthough Mr. Torongo and his family have invested time and money in acquiring claims, equipment and relevant knowledge, the dream of expanding their operation beyond its current size is no longer possible,\u201d the suit states.\n\n>BlueRibbon Coalition members, meanwhile, which include off-roaders and dirt bikers, fear they\u2019ll also face restrictions because of the \u201cgoal of maintaining the undeveloped character of the land,\u201d according to the suit.\n\n>The Interior Department hasn\u2019t yet responded to the suit and spokeswoman J. Elizabeth Peace said department policy is not to comment on litigation.\n\nApparently the miners, off-roaders and dirtbikers feel the designation is infringing on their enjoyment of these beautiful lands, and they have people with deep pockets working to overturn it.",
