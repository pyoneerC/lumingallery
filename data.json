When they were already on the boat they found their friend had forgotten a handgun in one of the bags. They reached out to my dad (an attorney) on what to do with it, he told them to throw it off the side of the boat and not bring it up to anyone. They did not and instead told staff about it. They were detained and the gun was confiscated and not returned to them or the owner and it was a big big hassle. No charges or anything though. To this day my uncle will say \u201cwe should\u2019ve just thrown it over the side.\u201d Lmao.",

The reason he was in court in front of this judge was because he lied about his identity to the Secretary of State. He knew if he gave his real name that his convictions and removal order would show up. Since states are refusing to work with federal agencies to remove ppl with felony convictions, how would people expect ICE to do their job? \n\nAn American with the same convictions would have essentially ruined their lives.

But like I said, people have bowel movements every day where they don\u2019t completely clean themselves and we don\u2019t fuss over too much. People are allowed to be dirty. It\u2019s when the dirty and the feces and the urine interfere with, you know, medical safety, like in someone who has concomitant comorbidities that you worry, but not in this specific case. I would allow him to be a little dirty for a couple days.\u201d\n\nOh yeah, the full context makes it sound *so much* better.",
