                "From the contacts I know at the Dept of Ed, the compliance department has been more or less decimated, and the ombudsman's office has also taken a massive hit if not completely destroyed as well. \n\nThese departments served as guide rails, keeping people on track and providing accountability. Things are going to get very very messy.\n\nDepts with firings: \n\n \u2022\u00a0National Center for Education Statistics\n\n \u2022\u00a0Institute of Education Sciences\n\n \u2022\u00a0Federal Student Aid\n\n \u2022\u00a0Office for Civil Rights\n\n \u2022\u00a0Office of Postsecondary Education \n\n \u2022\u00a0Office of General Counsel Ethics Division\n\nBoston, New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, San Francisco have been abolished.\u00a0 The offices spared are Denver, Kansas City, Seattle and DC Metro. DOED Office for Civil Rights\n\nOver 1800 people gone. \n\nThis is gonna have a MASSIVE down stream impact on K-12, Hs, and college level Education, data, compliance, and special education programs. \n\nPeople aren't really aware of what this will do. It's like being on a plane 20000ft jn the air and ripping out random wires because you dont think you need them.",

                "This is the kind of thing that should set off alarm bells, but somehow it just feels like another day in the slow dismantling of public services. Cutting nearly half a department overnight, with barely a warning, is not streamlining, it is sabotage. Even if you believe the Department of Education is bloated, you do not fix a system by gutting it in a way that leaves staff terrified and scrambling. \n\nPeople do not work well under fear, and a government that rules through uncertainty is more interested in control than competence. The bigger question is what comes next. If this is just the warm-up act for dismantling the department altogether, what does that mean for the millions of students and families who rely on federal education programmes? Anyone cheering this move might want to ask themselves whether they trust their local politicians to handle education funding fairly and effectively because that is where this is headed.",
