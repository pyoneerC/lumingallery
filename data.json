                "This tiny spot of good news is like when it rains *very lightly* for like 6 seconds, during a raging hellfire inferno that's destroying everything around you.\u00a0",
                "*Article Text by Jennifer Ludden:* \n\nThe Food and Drug administration has approved the U.S.'s first at-home alternative to the Pap smear, a procedure generations of women have dreaded and often found painful.\n\nThe new device by Teal Health will offer a \"much preferred experience,\" the company said in its announcement, and also aims to increase screening rates by making the procedure more convenient.\n\nTraditionally, gynecologists have inserted a cold metal speculum deep into a woman's vagina to scrape cells from the cervix.\n\nThe Teal Wand \u2014 \"built with empathy,\" the company said \u2014 uses a swab to collect a vaginal sample. Women will then mail the sample to a lab that will screen for HPV (human papillomavirus), the virus that causes nearly all cervical cancers. A growing body of research has found HPV testing to be highly accurate.\n\nThe FDA approval Friday follows a U.S.-based study that found at-home screening was just as effective as that done in a doctor's office. The study also found women overwhelmingly preferred self\u2013screening at home, and said they'd be more likely to stay up to date with cervical cancer screenings that way.\n\nEvery year, about 13,000 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed, and more than 4,000 women die from the disease. Rates are down dramatically since Dr. Georgios Papanicolaou published a 1943 paper on how to use the Pap smear for screening, and it then became common.\n\nBut about a quarter of women in the U.S. are behind on such screenings, and medical experts say reducing that is key to the ultimate goal of eliminating cervical cancer. There's also a racial gap, with Black and Native American women far more likely to die from cervical cancer than white women. The HPV vaccine for teen and preteen girls, introduced in 2007, has also led to a global push to tackle the disease that way.\n\nAt-home cervical cancer screenings are already available in several other countries, including Australia and Sweden.\n\nTeal Health says its self-testing device will be available starting next month, in California first and then expanding. It will be by prescription, through a telehealth service, for women 25-65 years old who are \"at average risk.\" The company says it's working with insurance companies to provide coverage.",
                "Sweet fuck thank you. I had an iud put in that went terribly wrong, leading to the Dr having to caulderize my cervix. Since then, even pap smears are too much for me. I put them off as long as I can due to anxiety, clenching, and pain. I'll definitely be using this as soon as it's available.",
                "Is much rather do it myself because I can slow down or stop when I feel pain or discomfort. Someone else just rams it in there and the whole process doesn\u2019t go fast enough so the discomfort and pain last longer. \n\nAlso, I had an inexperienced doctor react like she was revolted because she mistook what is a backed up sebaceous gland for an HPV wart. She literally jumped back from me and treated me like I was diseased. The HPV test was negative. I never went back to her and the last I heard she moved to the urgent care clinic where she belongs.",

Maria Fares told The Associated Press, adding that they had no power on the boat.\n\n>\u201cThey had no starter, lights and everything that a battery generates,\u201d she said. To survive, they had to \u201ctake rusted water out of the engine (and) when a fish passed by, they caught it and parboiled it to eat.\u201d Fares added that they also drank rain and sea water to survive.\n\n>The men are in stable condition and the navy said it is coordinating with local and foreign authorities to ensure their safe return to their respective countries.\n\n>Earlier this year, another Peruvian fisherman, 61-year-old M\u00e1ximo Napa, spent [95 days](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/18/americas/peruvian-fisherman-lost-at-sea-survived-intl-latam/index.html) at sea alone.

The fine was then doubled \u201cpursuant to an escalating penalty structure for repeat riding crop violations within the previous 180 days,\u201d resulting in a $62,000 fine, according to HISA.\n\nAlvarado was found to have struck Sovereignty eight times during the Kentucky Derby, which was his second offense in 180 days, per a HISA ruling. HISA protocol allows jockeys to strike horses a maximum of six times during a race.\n\nThe jockey was also suspended for two Kentucky racing days, May 29 and 30, as a result of the violation.\n\nThe jockey and Sovereignty won the 151st running of the Kentucky Derby last Saturday at Churchill Downs.",

You can whip the shit out of yourself and it isn't particularly painful, even on bare skin and in sensitive areas. The sound and the sensation are absolutely used to continue encouraging the horse to move forward. The limit was put into place to prevent an obscene amount of strikes going down the stretch. It is absolutely possible to lose track with the adrenaline of everything, especially once a jockey and horse fall into rhythm. The only type of legal whip used in US racing now is usually fiberglass wrapped in thick foam. It is designed to cause a loud sound more than cause pain.\n\n> For the record, jockeys won't make millions riding one race: they take home roughly 10% of the earnings. Jose Alvarado took home $310,000 for his effort; he acknowledges his mistake, he understands he was one strike over, and he will pay his $31,000 fine.\nUnsure if links are allowed, but this is a pretty fair assessment of the use of whips in racing.\n\n> https://lightupracing.com/why-are-whips-used-in-racing/",

                "*Article Text by Jennifer Ludden:* \n\nThe Food and Drug administration has approved the U.S.'s first at-home alternative to the Pap smear, a procedure generations of women have dreaded and often found painful.\n\nThe new device by Teal Health will offer a \"much preferred experience,\" the company said in its announcement, and also aims to increase screening rates by making the procedure more convenient.\n\nTraditionally, gynecologists have inserted a cold metal speculum deep into a woman's vagina to scrape cells from the cervix.\n\nThe Teal Wand \u2014 \"built with empathy,\" the company said \u2014 uses a swab to collect a vaginal sample. Women will then mail the sample to a lab that will screen for HPV (human papillomavirus), the virus that causes nearly all cervical cancers. A growing body of research has found HPV testing to be highly accurate.\n\nThe FDA approval Friday follows a U.S.-based study that found at-home screening was just as effective as that done in a doctor's office. The study also found women overwhelmingly preferred self\u2013screening at home, and said they'd be more likely to stay up to date with cervical cancer screenings that way.\n\nEvery year, about 13,000 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed, and more than 4,000 women die from the disease. Rates are down dramatically since Dr. Georgios Papanicolaou published a 1943 paper on how to use the Pap smear for screening, and it then became common.\n\nBut about a quarter of women in the U.S. are behind on such screenings, and medical experts say reducing that is key to the ultimate goal of eliminating cervical cancer. There's also a racial gap, with Black and Native American women far more likely to die from cervical cancer than white women. The HPV vaccine for teen and preteen girls, introduced in 2007, has also led to a global push to tackle the disease that way.\n\nAt-home cervical cancer screenings are already available in several other countries, including Australia and Sweden.\n\nTeal Health says its self-testing device will be available starting next month, in California first and then expanding. It will be by prescription, through a telehealth service, for women 25-65 years old who are \"at average risk.\" The company says it's working with insurance companies to provide coverage.",

I put them off as long as I can due to anxiety, clenching, and pain. I'll definitely be using this as soon as it's available.",
                "Is much rather do it myself because I can slow down or stop when I feel pain or discomfort. Someone else just rams it in there and the whole process doesn\u2019t go fast enough so the discomfort and pain last longer. \n\nAlso, I had an inexperienced doctor react like she was revolted because she mistook what is a backed up sebaceous gland for an HPV wart. She literally jumped back from me and treated me like I was diseased. The HPV test was negative. I never went back to her and the last I heard she moved to the urgent care clinic where she belongs.",

To survive, they had to \u201ctake rusted water out of the engine (and) when a fish passed by, they caught it and parboiled it to eat.\u201d Fares added that they also drank rain and sea water to survive.\n\n>The men are in stable condition and the navy said it is coordinating with local and foreign authorities to ensure their safe return to their respective countries.\n\n>Earlier this year, another Peruvian fisherman, 61-year-old M\u00e1ximo Napa, spent [95 days](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/18/americas/peruvian-fisherman-lost-at-sea-survived-intl-latam/index.html) at sea alone.

                "This tiny spot of good news is like when it rains *very lightly* for like 6 seconds, during a raging hellfire inferno that's destroying everything around you.\u00a0",
                "*Article Text by Jennifer Ludden:* \n\nThe Food and Drug administration has approved the U.S.'s first at-home alternative to the Pap smear, a procedure generations of women have dreaded and often found painful.\n\nThe new device by Teal Health will offer a \"much preferred experience,\" the company said in its announcement, and also aims to increase screening rates by making the procedure more convenient.\n\nTraditionally, gynecologists have inserted a cold metal speculum deep into a woman's vagina to scrape cells from the cervix.\n\nThe Teal Wand \u2014 \"built with empathy,\" the company said \u2014 uses a swab to collect a vaginal sample. Women will then mail the sample to a lab that will screen for HPV (human papillomavirus), the virus that causes nearly all cervical cancers. A growing body of research has found HPV testing to be highly accurate.\n\nThe FDA approval Friday follows a U.S.-based study that found at-home screening was just as effective as that done in a doctor's office. The study also found women overwhelmingly preferred self\u2013screening at home, and said they'd be more likely to stay up to date with cervical cancer screenings that way.\n\nEvery year, about 13,000 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed, and more than 4,000 women die from the disease. Rates are down dramatically since Dr. Georgios Papanicolaou published a 1943 paper on how to use the Pap smear for screening, and it then became common.\n\nBut about a quarter of women in the U.S. are behind on such screenings, and medical experts say reducing that is key to the ultimate goal of eliminating cervical cancer. There's also a racial gap, with Black and Native American women far more likely to die from cervical cancer than white women. The HPV vaccine for teen and preteen girls, introduced in 2007, has also led to a global push to tackle the disease that way.\n\nAt-home cervical cancer screenings are already available in several other countries, including Australia and Sweden.\n\nTeal Health says its self-testing device will be available starting next month, in California first and then expanding. It will be by prescription, through a telehealth service, for women 25-65 years old who are \"at average risk.\" The company says it's working with insurance companies to provide coverage.",
                "Sweet fuck thank you. I had an iud put in that went terribly wrong, leading to the Dr having to caulderize my cervix. Since then, even pap smears are too much for me. I put them off as long as I can due to anxiety, clenching, and pain. I'll definitely be using this as soon as it's available.",
                "Is much rather do it myself because I can slow down or stop when I feel pain or discomfort. Someone else just rams it in there and the whole process doesn\u2019t go fast enough so the discomfort and pain last longer. \n\nAlso, I had an inexperienced doctor react like she was revolted because she mistook what is a backed up sebaceous gland for an HPV wart. She literally jumped back from me and treated me like I was diseased. The HPV test was negative. I never went back to her and the last I heard she moved to the urgent care clinic where she belongs.",

He said the bus was coming from Morongo Valley, about 110 miles east of Los Angeles.\n\n>Images of the bus taken by ABC Los Angeles station [KABC](https://abc7.com/post/1-dead-dozens-injured-fiery-crash-between-suv-tour-bus-hacienda-heights-california-highway-patrol-says/16384161/) showed substantial front-end damage to the vehicle.\n\n>It was not immediately clear what caused the SUV to become disabled, Salazar said.\n\n>The CHP said neither alcohol nor drugs appeared to be a factor in the crash.",
                "Very odd story.  Firstly, why is a bus full of tourists heading from Moreno Valley to Downtown at 5 AM?  Secondly, the 60 being a major freeway, was the Nissan just sitting in the middle of the freeway lane or pulled over to the side, and why was the driver still in the disabled car if it was in unsafe lane?"

                "*Article Text By Mirna Alsharif and Matthew Mata:*\n\nThe jockey who rode Sovereignty to victory at the Kentucky Derby last week has been fined over $60,000 for striking the horse with his riding crop too many times during the race, according to the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority.\n\nJunior Alvarado was found to have struck the horse with his riding crop \u201cmore than the permitted amount\u201d during last week\u2019s race, violating the authority\u2019s rules, it said in a statement Saturday.\n\nA penalty was imposed against Alvarado on Friday for committing the Class 3 violation and he was hit with a fine equating to 10% of his $310,000 winnings, the statement said. The fine was then doubled \u201cpursuant to an escalating penalty structure for repeat riding crop violations within the previous 180 days,\u201d resulting in a $62,000 fine, according to HISA.\n\nAlvarado was found to have struck Sovereignty eight times during the Kentucky Derby, which was his second offense in 180 days, per a HISA ruling. HISA protocol allows jockeys to strike horses a maximum of six times during a race.\n\nThe jockey was also suspended for two Kentucky racing days, May 29 and 30, as a result of the violation.\n\nThe jockey and Sovereignty won the 151st running of the Kentucky Derby last Saturday at Churchill Downs.",

                "Yea but the horse will now makenthe owners millions of dollars in breeding fees. If im the horse owner id tell ny jockey to hit the horse as much as he wants and id pay the fine. $62k probably would cover the cost of one load of semen from the horse lol.",
                "\"HISA protocol allows jockeys to strike horses a maximum of six times during a race.\" \n\nJunior Alvarado was found to have exceeded the limit by 2.\n\nSo I suggest 2 flogs for Junior, and 6 flogs for the idiotic judges who came up with this rule and now banning flogging once and for all.",
                "Hopefully the jockey has learned a valuable lesson and from now on will only strike the horse an appropriate number of times.",

                "From a [reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/horseracing/comments/1khhnmf/kentucky_derbywinning_jockey_of_sovereignty_fined/mr7vjyw/) in the horse racing sub by /u/BasisTraditional6588, not sure how accurate, but potentially it\u2019s not as bad as it looks and the whips today are different than those historically used:\n\n> They're made of a type of foam. You can whip the shit out of yourself and it isn't particularly painful, even on bare skin and in sensitive areas. The sound and the sensation are absolutely used to continue encouraging the horse to move forward. The limit was put into place to prevent an obscene amount of strikes going down the stretch. It is absolutely possible to lose track with the adrenaline of everything, especially once a jockey and horse fall into rhythm. The only type of legal whip used in US racing now is usually fiberglass wrapped in thick foam. It is designed to cause a loud sound more than cause pain.\n\n> For the record, jockeys won't make millions riding one race: they take home roughly 10% of the earnings. Jose Alvarado took home $310,000 for his effort; he acknowledges his mistake, he understands he was one strike over, and he will pay his $31,000 fine.\nUnsure if links are allowed, but this is a pretty fair assessment of the use of whips in racing.\n\n> https://lightupracing.com/why-are-whips-used-in-racing/",

Thats the HARD part that needs a lot of infrastructure, power and skill.\n\nThere is a new one under construction in California. Its a $1.8Bln facility, owned by an Australian company. Otherwise the ore has to be export to Australia, Chile or China. The US does have some other processing capabilities, but its mostly the Aussies with the know-how (I guess it involves using shitty beer to do it? j/k). \n\nBear in mind that if its processed abroad thats 2 x shipping costs, plus hazards materials handling, plus a tariff.\n\nSo that $1.8Bln plant, even if its a smaller facility, will be really useful! But its not going to be able to handle all of it, or in a timely manner.\n\nThis is a good link for more info: [Lithium Supply Chain: Understanding the Basics | Shipping and Commodity Academy](https://shippingandcommodityacademy.com/blog/lithium-supply-chain-understanding-the-basics/) (other pages exist but they all say about the same thing. Obviously the \"US reserves\" are now slightly higher than on that page mind).",

It frequently translated to close to, or exceeded,  (BIG NUMBER).\n\n  \nJust like there are a number of 'rare earth mineral' deposits in the U.S....they just aren't practical to extract.",

(There's a summer camp there that predates the smokestacks that kids roll around in the dirt right THERE.) \n\nIn Butte, Montana and subsequently a 200 mile radius and anywhere in the MT/WY/NV area there are both smokestack areas of contamination and pools of deadly chemicals leftover from the 1800s-1970s. Pools of arsenic and lead. If you've been there you know.  Cows and horses just walk around grazing in these areas.\n\nPicher, Oklahoma - \"the most toxic ghost town\" in the USA. The entire story is a trip. Silent Hill type stuff. I went to a museum exhibit on it in Norman.\n\nEdmond, OK - currently having to treat it's watershed contaminated with fracking juices - oh but they won't tell you that.  They just want to see you bougie houses and ride out the earthquakes.  (source - Geologist who works for oil company who quit over it I dated - so dubious.) \n\nQuestion is not \"We make money now\"\n\nbut \"Where will we live AFTER the mine closes and we don't make money anymore?\"\n\nExample of Lithium Extract- from source:\n\n# Brine Extraction\n\nBrine extraction is another method of extracting lithium. This method involves pumping brine from underground aquifers into evaporation ponds. The sun and wind evaporate the water, leaving behind lithium and other minerals. The following are the steps involved in brine extraction:\n\n* Drilling: Wells are drilled into the ground to access the brine.\n* Pumping: The brine is pumped to the surface and transported to the evaporation ponds.\n* Evaporation: The brine is evaporated in the ponds, leaving behind lithium and other minerals.\n* Processing: The extracted lithium is then processed to produce lithium carbonate or other lithium compounds.\n\nBrine extraction is a less costly and less energy-intensive method of extracting lithium. It is also less harmful to the environment than hard rock mining. However, it is highly dependent on weather conditions, and the process can take several months to complete.\n\nOverall, both hard rock mining and brine extraction have their advantages and disadvantages. Companies choose the method that suits their needs and resources.\n\n#",
                "For those unaware, the U.S. has lithium in a ton of places but as of now the only real site that is extracting lithium in any meaningful capacity is in Nevada. There is a site that has been identified for development in Arizona as well.\n\nBut all of that is sort of moot because right now virtually all REFINING of lithium has to go through China so absent developing that domestic refining we won\u2019t be gaining independence any time soon.",
                "It's never the issue whether we have lithium mine or not. We always have the. It's just the environmental cost to mine and produce it."
