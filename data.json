                "This isn\u2019t redacted.\n\nFrom copilot:\n\nKatie Johnson filed a lawsuit against Donald Trump, alleging that he raped her when she was 13 years old. The case was dismissed almost a decade ago. The lawsuit claimed that the assaults happened at parties hosted by Jeffrey Epstein. You can find more details here.\n\nKatie Johnson\u2019s deposition was part of her lawsuit against Donald Trump, which was filed in federal court in Riverside, California, in April 2016. The lawsuit named Trump and Jeffrey Epstein as defendants and claimed that they held Johnson as a \u201csex slave\u201d and assaulted her when she was 13 years old. However, the case was dismissed shortly after it was filed. You can find more details here.\n\nKatie Johnson\u2019s lawsuit against Donald Trump was dismissed because the judge ruled that the complaint didn\u2019t raise valid claims under federal law. Additionally, there were legal hurdles, such as the statute of limitations on many of the claims, including sexual misconduct, assault, and battery. The case was dismissed in May 2016, and subsequent versions of the lawsuit were also withdrawn or dismissed.\n\nKatie Johnson\u2019s lawsuit against Donald Trump was withdrawn because she reportedly received threats and was too afraid to continue with the case. Her attorney, Lisa Bloom, mentioned that Johnson was too frightened to appear at a scheduled news conference. The case was ultimately dropped without further explanation.\n\nThe following is a portion of her deposition. It is graphic and troubling.\n\nhttps://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4154484/katie-johnson-v-donald-j-trump/\n\n9. On the first occasion involving the Defendant, Donald J. Trump, the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, was forced to manually stimulate Defendant Trump with the use of her hand upon Defendant Trump\u2019s erect penis until he reached sexual orgasm.\n\n10. On the second occasion involving the Defendant, Donald J. Trump, the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, was forced to orally copulate Defendant Trump by placing her mouth upon Defendant Trump\u2019s erect penis until he reached sexual orgasm.\n\n11. On the third occasion involving the Defendant, Donald J. Trump, the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson was forced to engage in an unnatural lesbian sex act with her fellow minor and sex slave, Maria Doe age 12, for the sexual enjoyment of Defendant Trump. After this sex act, both minors were forced to orally copulate Defendant Trump by placing their mouths simultaneously on his erect penis until he achieved sexual orgasm. After zipping up his pants, Defendant Trump physically pushed both minors away while angrily berating them for the \u201cpoor\u201d quality of their sexual performance.\n\n12. On the fourth and final sexual encounter with the Defendant, Donald J. Trump, the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, was tied to a bed by Defendant Trump who then proceeded to forcibly rape Plaintiff Johnson. During the course of this savage sexual attack, Plaintiff Johnson loudly pleaded with Defendant Trump to \u201cplease wear a condom\u201d. Defendant Trump responded by violently striking Plaintiff Johnson in the face with his open hand and screaming that \u201che would do whatever he wanted\u201d as he refused to wear protection. After achieving sexual orgasm, the Defendant, Donald J. Trump put his suit back on and when the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, in tears asked Defendant Trump what would happen if he had impregnated her, Defendant Trump grabbed his wallet and threw some money at her and screamed that she should use the money \u201cto get a fucking abortion\u201d.\n\n13. On the first occasion involving the Defendant, Jeffrey E. Epstein, the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, was forced to disrobe into her bra and panties and to give a full body massage to Defendant Epstein while he was completely naked. During the massage, Defendant Epstein physically forced Plaintiff Johnson to touch his erect penis with her bare hands and to clean up his ejaculated semen after he achieved sexual orgasm.\n\n14. On the second occasion involving the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson was again forced to disrobe into her bra and panties while giving Defendant Epstein a full body massage while he was completely naked. The Defendant, Donald J. Trump, was also present as he was getting his own massage from another minor, Jane Doe, age 13, Defendant Epstein forced Plaintiff Johnson to touch his erect penis by physically placing her bare hands upon his sex organ and again forced Plaintiff Johnson to clean up his ejaculated semen after he achieved sexual orgasm.\n\n15. Shortly after this sexual assault by the Defendant, Jeffrey E. Epstein, on the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, Plaintiff Johnson was still present while the two Defendants were arguing over who would be the one to take Plaintiff Johnson\u2019s virginity. The Defendant, Donald J. Trump, was clearly heard referring to Defendant, Jeffrey E. Epstein, as a \u201cJew Bastard\u201d as he yelled at Defendant Epstein, that clearly, he, Defendant Trump, should be the lucky one to \u201cpop the cherry\u201d of Plaintiff Johnson.\n\n16. The third and final sexual assault by the Defendant, Jeffrey E. Epstein, on the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, took place after Plaintiff Johnson had been brutally and savagely raped by Defendant Trump. While receiving another full body massage from Plaintiff Johnson, while in the nude, Defendant Epstein became so enraged after finding out that Defendant Trump had been the one to take Plaintiff Johnson\u2019s virginity, that Defendant Epstein also violently raped Plaintiff Johnson. After forcing Plaintiff Johnson to disrobe into her bra and panties, while receiving a massage from the Plaintiff, Defendant Epstein attempted to enter Plaintiff Johnson\u2019s anal cavity with his erect penis while trying to restrain her. Plaintiff Johnson attempted to push Defendant Epstein away, at which time Defendant Epstein attempted to enter Plaintiff Johnson\u2019s vagina with his erect penis. This attempt to brutally sodomize and rape Plaintiff Johnson by Defendant Epstein was finally repelled by Plaintiff Johnson but not before Defendant Epstein was able to achieve sexual orgasm. After perversely sodomizing and raping the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, the Defendant, Jeffrey E. Epstein, attempted to strike her about the head with his closed fists while he angrily screamed at Plaintiff Johnson that he, Defendant Epstein, should have been the one who \u201ctook her cherry, not Mr. Trump\u201d, before she finally managed to break away from Defendant Epstein.\n\n17. The Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, was fully warned on more than one occasion by both Defendants, Donald J. Trump and Jeffrey E. Epstein, that were she ever to reveal any of the details of the sexual and physical abuse that she had suffered as a sex slave for Defendant Trump and Defendant Epstein, that Plaintiff Johnson and her family would be in mortal danger. Plaintiff Johnson was warned that this would mean certain death for herself and Plaintiff Johnson\u2019s family unless she remained silent forever on the exact details of the depraved and perverted sexual and physical abuse she had been forced to endure from the Defendants.\n\nTiffany Doe Declaration | T\u00e9l\u00e9charger gratuitement PDF | Rape | Violence (scribd.com)"

                "#Tear Gas and Turmoil as Turkey Rises for Justice\n\nThe streets of Istanbul have been lit up not by celebration but by the fierce glow of protest as thousands rally for justice following the arrest of the city\u2019s mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu. For four nights running, crowds have surged across Turkey\u2019s major cities, marking the country\u2019s largest wave of demonstrations in over a decade. What began with a few scattered gatherings has now grown into a roar of resistance.\n\nImamoglu, long seen as a serious rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, was taken into custody on Wednesday, just days before his party was expected to confirm him as their presidential candidate for 2028. Accused of corruption and aiding terrorist groups, charges he flatly denies, his arrest has shaken the political landscape and drawn thousands into the streets demanding his release.\n\nOn Saturday, he appeared in court, his supporters chanting \"rights, law, justice\" outside as tear gas swirled in the cold night air. Riot police stood shoulder to shoulder, firing round after round to break up the crowds, but still they came. Mothers holding their children, students in masks, pensioners waving flags, all united by a shared belief that something fundamental is slipping away.\n\n\"I'm here for liberty,\" one young woman told the BBC, her face hidden behind a mask. \"Turkish people cannot accept this. This is against our behaviour and culture.\" Her words echoed the mood across Istanbul, where the government has banned public gatherings in a bid to quell the unrest. But the ban only seems to have poured fuel on the fire.\n\nIn Izmir and Ankara, the story was much the same. Water cannons, arrests, more tear gas. On Friday alone, 343 people were reportedly detained. Still, the crowds held their ground, shouting not in anger but in defiance, determined to be heard. There is an unmistakable feeling that this is no longer just about one man, but about the future of democracy itself in Turkey.\n\nImamoglu\u2019s bid for the presidency now hangs in the balance. Just a day before his arrest, Istanbul University stripped him of his degree, citing irregularities. If upheld, this would disqualify him from running, as Turkish law requires a university qualification for presidential candidates. The timing has raised eyebrows across the political spectrum.\n\nPresident Erdogan, who has ruled the country for over two decades, cannot stand again in 2028 unless the constitution is changed. Critics argue that the arrests of Imamoglu and more than a hundred others, including journalists and business figures, are an attempt to clear the political field before the next election. The government, for its part, insists the judiciary is acting independently and has hit out at those suggesting otherwise.\n\nWhether or not that claim holds weight, what is clear is that a growing number of Turkish citizens feel they are being silenced. The sheer courage of those risking arrest to march night after night speaks volumes. These protests are no longer just about one politician behind bars. They are about the soul of a nation, and the kind of future its people are willing to fight for.",

                "#Tear Gas and Turmoil as Turkey Rises for Justice\n\nThe streets of Istanbul have been lit up not by celebration but by the fierce glow of protest as thousands rally for justice following the arrest of the city\u2019s mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu. For four nights running, crowds have surged across Turkey\u2019s major cities, marking the country\u2019s largest wave of demonstrations in over a decade. What began with a few scattered gatherings has now grown into a roar of resistance.\n\nImamoglu, long seen as a serious rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, was taken into custody on Wednesday, just days before his party was expected to confirm him as their presidential candidate for 2028. Accused of corruption and aiding terrorist groups, charges he flatly denies, his arrest has shaken the political landscape and drawn thousands into the streets demanding his release.\n\nOn Saturday, he appeared in court, his supporters chanting \"rights, law, justice\" outside as tear gas swirled in the cold night air. Riot police stood shoulder to shoulder, firing round after round to break up the crowds, but still they came. Mothers holding their children, students in masks, pensioners waving flags, all united by a shared belief that something fundamental is slipping away.\n\n\"I'm here for liberty,\" one young woman told the BBC, her face hidden behind a mask. \"Turkish people cannot accept this. This is against our behaviour and culture.\" Her words echoed the mood across Istanbul, where the government has banned public gatherings in a bid to quell the unrest. But the ban only seems to have poured fuel on the fire.\n\nIn Izmir and Ankara, the story was much the same. Water cannons, arrests, more tear gas. On Friday alone, 343 people were reportedly detained. Still, the crowds held their ground, shouting not in anger but in defiance, determined to be heard. There is an unmistakable feeling that this is no longer just about one man, but about the future of democracy itself in Turkey.\n\nImamoglu\u2019s bid for the presidency now hangs in the balance. Just a day before his arrest, Istanbul University stripped him of his degree, citing irregularities. If upheld, this would disqualify him from running, as Turkish law requires a university qualification for presidential candidates. The timing has raised eyebrows across the political spectrum.\n\nPresident Erdogan, who has ruled the country for over two decades, cannot stand again in 2028 unless the constitution is changed. Critics argue that the arrests of Imamoglu and more than a hundred others, including journalists and business figures, are an attempt to clear the political field before the next election. The government, for its part, insists the judiciary is acting independently and has hit out at those suggesting otherwise.\n\nWhether or not that claim holds weight, what is clear is that a growing number of Turkish citizens feel they are being silenced. The sheer courage of those risking arrest to march night after night speaks volumes. These protests are no longer just about one politician behind bars. They are about the soul of a nation, and the kind of future its people are willing to fight for.",
                "I was in the protests in \u0130zmir yesterday and today, and the police have been illegally throwing pepper spray bombs in the air, using concentrated pepper gas, pepper gas releasing plastic bullets, pressurized water and agent orange with riot control vehicles, and shooting people with plastic bullets, and doing all that without announcing they were going to use excessive force to the public, which is also illegal."
