It was the worst cough I'd ever had in my life, and you might say \"Why Tycho-Celchu, coughs aren't that bad, it's more of a minor annoyance when you're sick.\" and I cannot stress enough: No it is fucking horrible. It's horrible racking coughs that feel like any second your lung tissue is about to be expunged. I would get coughing fits so bad my stomach would contract and I'd throw up. Imagine with every cough you're vomiting more and more and when there's nothing left you're just retching with every hack.\n\nOh and you know what the alternative name for whooping cough is? The cough of a hundred days. And trust me, you feel everyone of those hundred days. I missed the last month of grade 10 because of it, I went to class once and I coughed so hard I wasn't able to breathe and the entire class panicked and thought I was going to die, complete with my teacher trying frantically to call 911 while I'm trying to stop her. When I showed up for the 1st day in grade 11, there were people I weren't friends with stopping to chat with me because I didn't come back to school after that and they thought I had died.",
