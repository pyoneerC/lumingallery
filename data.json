THIS is how he repays our generosity:\n\nDestroying American Institutions, Chainsawing through our assets and  investments, Terminating those working to keep the government's pact with The People, Threatening those who defy him with prison or illegal rendition.\n\nHe's proud of it.  And with billions in the bank, this compulsive liar and grifter throws bribes at American voters to recruit MORE devils to do his bidding.\n\nMusk is THE most grotesque Potter (\"It's a Wonderful Life\"), whose only friend and family is money, whose only aim in life is replacing our best hopes for America - the source of his wealth - with a dark, evil, dystopian nightmare.",

I don\u2019t have family I can rely on financially, and I earn JUST enough to be disqualified from food stamps, internet subsidies, and most other assistance programs. I even considered asking my employers to pay me less.\n\nThe public library has been a lifeline for me. I get free internet there (hotspot I can take home), access to the graphic design software I use for work, and even borrow kitchen and hardware tools. Unlike many programs, the library doesn\u2019t require you to prove you\u2019re poor \u2014 it just helps.\n\nThis is why cutting funding or undermining libraries is not just shortsighted \u2014 it\u2019s harmful. The library gave me hope when I had to cancel my internet service. It continues to fill gaps that our safety net leaves behind.\n\nI\u2019m attending a protest today because these \u201csmaller\u201d cuts and policy changes are easy for people to ignore. Part of me fears it\u2019ll take something as big as Social Security or Medicare being touched before people realize what\u2019s at stake.",

                "If anyone is wondering why Musk and Friends are targeting schools and libraries so viciously, history holds the answer. Slavery \"officially\" ended in America in 1865, but it continued for decades thanks to loopholes in the form of predatory contracts. African Americans who had been kept illiterate by slavery were tricked into signing contracts with their former masters in which they were sold land in exchange for a percentage of their crops. The contracts were routinely altered, however, to make it impossible to actually pay off that land, creating a cycle of permanent debt slavery. It wasn't until reformers from the North started opening Black schools, and the people became educated, that African Americans were able to read and understand the contracts they were signing, seek legal counsel, find representation in Washington, etc. In other words, slavery doesn't end with an amendment. It ends with education.",

Directly, through things like myriad religious wars, the Trail of Tears, the Crusades and the Spanish Inquesition, and indirectly, through their faith being used as an excuse to persecute minorities in basically every conceivable way. Even things like the Holocaust can indirectly be tied to Christianity and Christians doing their thing.\n\nIf the church listened to it's own teachings, it wouldn't be fucking rich.\n\nAlso let's not forget modern things, like only providing aid to people in Africa if they convert, or suppressing gays, or covering up child abuse on a massive scale, or about fighting against science, or even just not practicing the things they even preach, and changing the rules about which things in the Bible they follow and which they dont. Basically every Christian alive today cherry picks what rules from the Bible they want to follow, and which rules they choose to pretend dont exist.\n\nSo basically fuck this guy.

Can go much deeper in to the story but I won\u2019t bore y\u2019all. It was scary. She knew my address, phone number (land line back then) my vehicle, my overall everything. I was at my GF\u2019s house after school, did some day boozing, walked 2 blocks home, and went to bed. Then I was \u201cwoken up\u201d about 4 hours later. Lots of people I\u2019ve told the story too have said \u201cI\u2019ve had handled it this way\u201d. But I was woken up from a dead sleep, completely confused, 3 cops screaming at me, my dad freaking out, my mom in hysterics. \n\nThere were no consequences for the accuser. I moved across country for school and that was it. That was around \u201889 or \u201890. Fucking sucked.",

I suspect she had the same sort of relationship with the next guy she started dating - because I know she was very upset with him.  showed up at a bar, and acted all drunk, and brought him out to her car, where she had sex with him.  he went back into the bar and she ran in and said he raped her.  \n\nThe guy was taken away in handcuffs, and couldn't believe what was happening to him.  She eventually came clean, but the damage was done - the dude had mugshots, and was arrested in the middle of a crowded bar.  she didn't get so much as a slap on the wrist.  From what I understand, the guy was just so happy to have the charges dropped against him.  But he should have pressed charges against her for the damage she did to him.  \n\nThis was about 20 years ago that this happened.  and I still worry about how I was just a few months away from being 'the guy' in this story.",

The library gave me hope when I had to cancel my internet service. It continues to fill gaps that our safety net leaves behind.\n\nI\u2019m attending a protest today because these \u201csmaller\u201d cuts and policy changes are easy for people to ignore.

                "If anyone is wondering why Musk and Friends are targeting schools and libraries so viciously, history holds the answer. Slavery \"officially\" ended in America in 1865, but it continued for decades thanks to loopholes in the form of predatory contracts. African Americans who had been kept illiterate by slavery were tricked into signing contracts with their former masters in which they were sold land in exchange for a percentage of their crops. The contracts were routinely altered, however, to make it impossible to actually pay off that land, creating a cycle of permanent debt slavery. It wasn't until reformers from the North started opening Black schools, and the people became educated, that African Americans were able to read and understand the contracts they were signing, seek legal counsel, find representation in Washington, etc. In other words, slavery doesn't end with an amendment. It ends with education.",

Slavery \"officially\" ended in America in 1865, but it continued for decades thanks to loopholes in the form of predatory contracts. African Americans who had been kept illiterate by slavery were tricked into signing contracts with their former masters in which they were sold land in exchange for a percentage of their crops. The contracts were routinely altered, however, to make it impossible to actually pay off that land, creating a cycle of permanent debt slavery. It wasn't until reformers from the North started opening Black schools, and the people became educated, that African Americans were able to read and understand the contracts they were signing, seek legal counsel, find representation in Washington, etc. In other words, slavery doesn't end with an amendment.
