Fencing is a single-division sport with schools from all three NCAA divisions competing against each other.\n\nHere\u2019s some facts for all the morons talking about the \u201cbiological advantage\u201d men have in fencing. It\u2019s been a coed sport at the national competition level for nearly FOURTY YEARS.

Old people dying alone in tents and hovels because of no money and government help. \n\n20-25% Unemployment. \n\nI fear to get from Trump to anyone sane will take a similar amount of time, and Trump and the people working him know his. That's why they are doing everything possible to make elections *impossible for anyone but the ruling party to win*. This is how it works in Russia and other Dictator/Oligarchic led countries. You can be pissed and angry at their actions all you want, all that matters is that come election day you either don't show up, the party in power makes it illegal for anyone supporting the opposition to vote, or the people counting the votes lie about the results.\n\nSo cry today if you like, but if what is happening now is pissing you off, remember that in a year and half there are ***midterms***, where you can register your anger. Don't let a single clown with an (R) by their name slide by. Challenge them everywhere, even in places where you have been told it's pointless.\n\nIf you were one of those people that thought nothing would actually change, or that both parties are the same, remember today... looking at your retirement savings as they drop through the floor. If you work at a business where people are now fearful of contracts, and jobs being cancelled... or wondering if you might be fired. Remember the panic and the fear and anger. Remember that when reasonable intelligent people warned you that you didn't listen, and then do something about it."

                "So I feel like this needs to be added, for the 'obviously Sullivan had an unfair advantage' crowd.\n\nI think [this](https://member.usafencing.org/details/tournaments/9012) was the event (fits the time and location).  Specifically in the Division IA Women's Foil, I don't see Sullivan's name in any other event.  \n\nSullivan ended up 24th out of 39, with Turner being 39th as DNF.\n\nIf Sullivan had an advantage, it appears to have been marginal at best.  If you are worried about the 'Majesty of competition', I should note that it does not appear the national news gave a damn about this competition until there was culture war content to be made out of the proceedings.",

Poor people living in Hoovervilles larger then the small towns they left. Children starving to death on public roads begging for food. Old people dying alone in tents and hovels because of no money and government help. \n\n20-25% Unemployment. \n\nI fear to get from Trump to anyone sane will take a similar amount of time, and Trump and the people working him know his. That's why they are doing everything possible to make elections *impossible for anyone but the ruling party to win*. This is how it works in Russia and other Dictator/Oligarchic led countries. You can be pissed and angry at their actions all you want, all that matters is that come election day you either don't show up, the party in power makes it illegal for anyone supporting the opposition to vote, or the people counting the votes lie about the results.\n\nSo cry today if you like, but if what is happening now is pissing you off, remember that in a year and half there are ***midterms***, where you can register your anger. Don't let a single clown with an (R) by their name slide by. Challenge them everywhere, even in places where you have been told it's pointless.\n\nIf you were one of those people that thought nothing would actually change, or that both parties are the same, remember today... looking at your retirement savings as they drop through the floor. If you work at a business where people are now fearful of contracts, and jobs being cancelled... or wondering if you might be fired. Remember the panic and the fear and anger. Remember that when reasonable intelligent people warned you that you didn't listen, and then do something about it."
