                "THE ARTICLE TITLE IS MISLEADING AND A LIE. \n\nTrump didnt do anything and the EOs and Presidential memorandums directing for a massive downsizing of the federal government are still in place. All that happened was that the Office of Personnel and Management (OPM), which is kinda like the whole governments HR and who makes policies, rescinded a memo that they wrote implementing the Presidential EOs and Memoranda. This was done because OPM can\u2019t legally tell other departments to fire people and the Courts have pointed that out in some injunctions and court cases that have been brought. \n\nTHIS MEMO BEING RESCINDED DOES NOTHING OTHER THAN TELL AGENCIES THEY NEED TO MAKE THE DETERMINATION TO FIRE PROBATIONARY (new) EMPLOYEES \u2018THEMSELVES\u2019. The government is still going to fire all these new employees just it would be at \u2018agency discretion\u2019.  And just removes a very low hanging fruit for these wrongfully terminated employees to be fired over. \n\nand we are already seeing this happen. The DoD yesterday signed a memo that says \u201c the Department is taking independent steps to reduce the size of the civilian workforce.\u201d",
