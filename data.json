                "Nike will raise prices on a wide range of footwear, apparel and equipment as soon as this week as the retail industry braces for tariffs to hit its profits, CNBC has learned.\n\nPrices for Nike apparel and equipment for adults will increase between $2 and $10, a person familiar with the matter said. Footwear priced between $100 and $150 will see a hike of $5, while sneakers priced above $150 will see a $10 increase, the person said.\n\nThe price hikes will be in effect by June 1, but could be seen on shelves as soon as this week, the person said. The increases cover a large portion of Nike\u2019s assortment, but many products will remain the same price.\n\nThe prices of children\u2019s products will not increase, nor will items priced under $100, according to the person. The company is trying to be cognizant of the financial challenges families are facing and doesn\u2019t want parents to see higher prices when shopping for their children during the back to school season.\n\nFurther, Nike\u2019s Air Force 1 shoe will remain $115, the person said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shoe that people in the workplace wear,\u201d the person said. \u201cIt\u2019s comfortable, accessible.\u201d\n\nJordan brand apparel and accessories also won\u2019t see increases, but Jordan sneakers will.\n\nNike said in a statement that \u201cwe regularly evaluate our business and make pricing adjustments as part of our seasonal planning.\u201d The company did not say the decision was related to tariffs.\n\nWhile it is common for retailers to regularly adjust their pricing structure, the footwear industry has been particularly hard hit by President Donald Trump\u2019s new tariffs.\n\nCurrently, Nike manufacturers about half of its footwear in China and Vietnam, which Trump has hit with his new levies. Chinese goods face a new 30% tariff, while imports from Vietnam are currently subject to a 10% duty. Trump cut the tariff rate on Vietnamese goods from 46% for 90 days in early April.\n\nTariffs are expected to hit Nike\u2019s profit margin and it can offset the effect through price increases, especially as the sneaker giant works through a turnaround that\u2019s taking longer than expected. Nike\u2019s profits were already under pressure before tariffs took effect because it has needed to rely on discounting to move product.\n\nThe price hikes will be the MSRP rate that consumers see at Nike stores and on its website. It has sent a note out to wholesale partners about the price increases, but how they\u2019ll show up at places like Dick\u2019s Sporting Goodsand Foot Locker isn\u2019t immediately clear.",

Footwear priced between $100 and $150 will see a hike of $5, while sneakers priced above $150 will see a $10 increase, the person said.\n\nThe price hikes will be in effect by June 1, but could be seen on shelves as soon as this week, the person said. The increases cover a large portion of Nike\u2019s assortment, but many products will remain the same price.\n\nThe prices of children\u2019s products will not increase, nor will items priced under $100, according to the person. The company is trying to be cognizant of the financial challenges families are facing and doesn\u2019t want parents to see higher prices when shopping for their children during the back to school season.\n\nFurther, Nike\u2019s Air Force 1 shoe will remain $115, the person said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shoe that people in the workplace wear,\u201d the person said. \u201cIt\u2019s comfortable, accessible.\u201d\n\nJordan brand apparel and accessories also won\u2019t see increases, but Jordan sneakers will.\n\nNike said in a statement that \u201cwe regularly evaluate our business and make pricing adjustments as part of our seasonal planning.\u201d The company did not say the decision was related to tariffs.\n\nWhile it is common for retailers to regularly adjust their pricing structure, the footwear industry has been particularly hard hit by President Donald Trump\u2019s new tariffs.\n\nCurrently, Nike manufacturers about half of its footwear in China and Vietnam, which Trump has hit with his new levies. Chinese goods face a new 30% tariff, while imports from Vietnam are currently subject to a 10% duty. Trump cut the tariff rate on Vietnamese goods from 46% for 90 days in early April.\n\nTariffs are expected to hit Nike\u2019s profit margin and it can offset the effect through price increases, especially as the sneaker giant works through a turnaround that\u2019s taking longer than expected. Nike\u2019s profits were already under pressure before tariffs took effect because it has needed to rely on discounting to move product.\n\nThe price hikes will be the MSRP rate that consumers see at Nike stores and on its website. It has sent a note out to wholesale partners about the price increases, but how they\u2019ll show up at places like Dick\u2019s Sporting Goodsand Foot Locker isn\u2019t immediately clear.",

In some cases, the Medicare/Medicaid payment falls below the actual cost of delivering care. Rural hospitals are also more often located in states that refused Medicaid expansion through Obamacare, which means patients who carry no insurance whatsoever.\n\nAt the same time, these hospitals have higher expenses. Rural hospitals struggle to recruit and retain staff, leading to higher labor costs per-patient. Increasingly, they rely on travel nurses or contract physicians to fill the gaps, both of which are more expensive than their traditional staffing counterparts. They also suffer from higher debt loads, costs from deferred maintenance, and antiquated equipment, all of which raise costs.\n\nNaturally, the planned cuts to government healthcare will exacerbate these problems.

                "Nike will raise prices on a wide range of footwear, apparel and equipment as soon as this week as the retail industry braces for tariffs to hit its profits, CNBC has learned.\n\nPrices for Nike apparel and equipment for adults will increase between $2 and $10, a person familiar with the matter said. Footwear priced between $100 and $150 will see a hike of $5, while sneakers priced above $150 will see a $10 increase, the person said.\n\nThe price hikes will be in effect by June 1, but could be seen on shelves as soon as this week, the person said. The increases cover a large portion of Nike\u2019s assortment, but many products will remain the same price.\n\nThe prices of children\u2019s products will not increase, nor will items priced under $100, according to the person. The company is trying to be cognizant of the financial challenges families are facing and doesn\u2019t want parents to see higher prices when shopping for their children during the back to school season.\n\nFurther, Nike\u2019s Air Force 1 shoe will remain $115, the person said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shoe that people in the workplace wear,\u201d the person said. \u201cIt\u2019s comfortable, accessible.\u201d\n\nJordan brand apparel and accessories also won\u2019t see increases, but Jordan sneakers will.\n\nNike said in a statement that \u201cwe regularly evaluate our business and make pricing adjustments as part of our seasonal planning.\u201d The company did not say the decision was related to tariffs.\n\nWhile it is common for retailers to regularly adjust their pricing structure, the footwear industry has been particularly hard hit by President Donald Trump\u2019s new tariffs.\n\nCurrently, Nike manufacturers about half of its footwear in China and Vietnam, which Trump has hit with his new levies. Chinese goods face a new 30% tariff, while imports from Vietnam are currently subject to a 10% duty. Trump cut the tariff rate on Vietnamese goods from 46% for 90 days in early April.\n\nTariffs are expected to hit Nike\u2019s profit margin and it can offset the effect through price increases, especially as the sneaker giant works through a turnaround that\u2019s taking longer than expected. Nike\u2019s profits were already under pressure before tariffs took effect because it has needed to rely on discounting to move product.\n\nThe price hikes will be the MSRP rate that consumers see at Nike stores and on its website. It has sent a note out to wholesale partners about the price increases, but how they\u2019ll show up at places like Dick\u2019s Sporting Goodsand Foot Locker isn\u2019t immediately clear.",
