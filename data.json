                "This isn\u2019t redacted.\n\nFrom copilot:\n\nKatie Johnson filed a lawsuit against Donald Trump, alleging that he raped her when she was 13 years old. The case was dismissed almost a decade ago. The lawsuit claimed that the assaults happened at parties hosted by Jeffrey Epstein. You can find more details here.\n\nKatie Johnson\u2019s deposition was part of her lawsuit against Donald Trump, which was filed in federal court in Riverside, California, in April 2016. The lawsuit named Trump and Jeffrey Epstein as defendants and claimed that they held Johnson as a \u201csex slave\u201d and assaulted her when she was 13 years old. However, the case was dismissed shortly after it was filed. You can find more details here.\n\nKatie Johnson\u2019s lawsuit against Donald Trump was dismissed because the judge ruled that the complaint didn\u2019t raise valid claims under federal law. Additionally, there were legal hurdles, such as the statute of limitations on many of the claims, including sexual misconduct, assault, and battery. The case was dismissed in May 2016, and subsequent versions of the lawsuit were also withdrawn or dismissed.\n\nKatie Johnson\u2019s lawsuit against Donald Trump was withdrawn because she reportedly received threats and was too afraid to continue with the case. Her attorney, Lisa Bloom, mentioned that Johnson was too frightened to appear at a scheduled news conference. The case was ultimately dropped without further explanation.\n\nThe following is a portion of her deposition. It is graphic and troubling.\n\nhttps://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4154484/katie-johnson-v-donald-j-trump/\n\n9. On the first occasion involving the Defendant, Donald J. Trump, the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, was forced to manually stimulate Defendant Trump with the use of her hand upon Defendant Trump\u2019s erect penis until he reached sexual orgasm.\n\n10. On the second occasion involving the Defendant, Donald J. Trump, the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, was forced to orally copulate Defendant Trump by placing her mouth upon Defendant Trump\u2019s erect penis until he reached sexual orgasm.\n\n11. On the third occasion involving the Defendant, Donald J. Trump, the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson was forced to engage in an unnatural lesbian sex act with her fellow minor and sex slave, Maria Doe age 12, for the sexual enjoyment of Defendant Trump. After this sex act, both minors were forced to orally copulate Defendant Trump by placing their mouths simultaneously on his erect penis until he achieved sexual orgasm. After zipping up his pants, Defendant Trump physically pushed both minors away while angrily berating them for the \u201cpoor\u201d quality of their sexual performance.\n\n12. On the fourth and final sexual encounter with the Defendant, Donald J. Trump, the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, was tied to a bed by Defendant Trump who then proceeded to forcibly rape Plaintiff Johnson. During the course of this savage sexual attack, Plaintiff Johnson loudly pleaded with Defendant Trump to \u201cplease wear a condom\u201d. Defendant Trump responded by violently striking Plaintiff Johnson in the face with his open hand and screaming that \u201che would do whatever he wanted\u201d as he refused to wear protection. After achieving sexual orgasm, the Defendant, Donald J. Trump put his suit back on and when the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, in tears asked Defendant Trump what would happen if he had impregnated her, Defendant Trump grabbed his wallet and threw some money at her and screamed that she should use the money \u201cto get a fucking abortion\u201d.\n\n13. On the first occasion involving the Defendant, Jeffrey E. Epstein, the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, was forced to disrobe into her bra and panties and to give a full body massage to Defendant Epstein while he was completely naked. During the massage, Defendant Epstein physically forced Plaintiff Johnson to touch his erect penis with her bare hands and to clean up his ejaculated semen after he achieved sexual orgasm.\n\n14. On the second occasion involving the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson was again forced to disrobe into her bra and panties while giving Defendant Epstein a full body massage while he was completely naked. The Defendant, Donald J. Trump, was also present as he was getting his own massage from another minor, Jane Doe, age 13, Defendant Epstein forced Plaintiff Johnson to touch his erect penis by physically placing her bare hands upon his sex organ and again forced Plaintiff Johnson to clean up his ejaculated semen after he achieved sexual orgasm.\n\n15. Shortly after this sexual assault by the Defendant, Jeffrey E. Epstein, on the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, Plaintiff Johnson was still present while the two Defendants were arguing over who would be the one to take Plaintiff Johnson\u2019s virginity. The Defendant, Donald J. Trump, was clearly heard referring to Defendant, Jeffrey E. Epstein, as a \u201cJew Bastard\u201d as he yelled at Defendant Epstein, that clearly, he, Defendant Trump, should be the lucky one to \u201cpop the cherry\u201d of Plaintiff Johnson.\n\n16. The third and final sexual assault by the Defendant, Jeffrey E. Epstein, on the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, took place after Plaintiff Johnson had been brutally and savagely raped by Defendant Trump. While receiving another full body massage from Plaintiff Johnson, while in the nude, Defendant Epstein became so enraged after finding out that Defendant Trump had been the one to take Plaintiff Johnson\u2019s virginity, that Defendant Epstein also violently raped Plaintiff Johnson. After forcing Plaintiff Johnson to disrobe into her bra and panties, while receiving a massage from the Plaintiff, Defendant Epstein attempted to enter Plaintiff Johnson\u2019s anal cavity with his erect penis while trying to restrain her. Plaintiff Johnson attempted to push Defendant Epstein away, at which time Defendant Epstein attempted to enter Plaintiff Johnson\u2019s vagina with his erect penis. This attempt to brutally sodomize and rape Plaintiff Johnson by Defendant Epstein was finally repelled by Plaintiff Johnson but not before Defendant Epstein was able to achieve sexual orgasm. After perversely sodomizing and raping the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, the Defendant, Jeffrey E. Epstein, attempted to strike her about the head with his closed fists while he angrily screamed at Plaintiff Johnson that he, Defendant Epstein, should have been the one who \u201ctook her cherry, not Mr. Trump\u201d, before she finally managed to break away from Defendant Epstein.\n\n17. The Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, was fully warned on more than one occasion by both Defendants, Donald J. Trump and Jeffrey E. Epstein, that were she ever to reveal any of the details of the sexual and physical abuse that she had suffered as a sex slave for Defendant Trump and Defendant Epstein, that Plaintiff Johnson and her family would be in mortal danger. Plaintiff Johnson was warned that this would mean certain death for herself and Plaintiff Johnson\u2019s family unless she remained silent forever on the exact details of the depraved and perverted sexual and physical abuse she had been forced to endure from the Defendants.\n\nTiffany Doe Declaration | T\u00e9l\u00e9charger gratuitement PDF | Rape | Violence (scribd.com)",

                "From The CBC:\n\n>The Ottawa-Carleton District School Board (OCDSB) is locked in a court battle to compel social media site Reddit to turn over identifying information of a user who it alleges has been defaming staff at a local elementary school.\n\n>The board alleges the posts about ongoing issues at Pinecrest Public School were made in an attempt to defame employees \u201cfor some unknown ulterior motive.\u201d None of the allegations have been proven in court.\n\n>The board wants Reddit to provide any email addresses, phone numbers, location data and other identifying information about the user. In a statement, it said it was compelled by its \u201cunwavering dedication to creating a positive and supportive environment for all members of the OCDSB community.\u201d\n\n>Reddit argues handing over the information will create a chill among other users, explaining in its court filings that \u201canonymity is not just a user preference but a defining feature of Reddit\u2019s business model and identity.\u201d\n\n>Most of the comments in question were in response to discussions around news stories about the board and problems at specific schools. Several involved specific incidents and ongoing issues at Pinecrest Public School that have been reported in the media.\n\n>Some of the comments singled out the school\u2019s principal and a superintendent, the board said in its court filings. Reddit\u2019s court filings mention 51 comments by the user in 17 different conversations. \n\n>User alleged OCDSB failed to report violence, racism. According to the OCDSB, the \u201cfalse and defamatory\u201d comments began on Dec. 17, 2022. Naming individual staff members, the user accused them of failing to report incidents, stifling investigations and ignoring instances of racism.\n\n>According to the board, the comments were dishonest, disrespectful and created a toxic work environment.

In a response to another user, the individual being sought by the board described themselves as a teacher. \n\n>The board said it\u2019s considering a defamation lawsuit against the person responsible for posting the comments. But Reddit denies OCDSB\u2019s claim that the information is \u201cnecessary for it to determine whether to pursue a potential claim for defamation.\u201d\n\n>OCDSB \u2018vigorously defending\u2019 employees. In response to CBC\u2019s request for comment, OCDSB communications manager Diane Pernari said the board is committed to \u201cvigorously defending our employees against unfounded attacks and upholding our legal and ethical obligations.\u201d\n\n>She wrote the legal action underscores the board\u2019s \u201cunwavering dedication to creating a positive and supportive environment for all members of the OCDSB community.\u201d Known as a Norwich Order, the board\u2019s application seeks to compel a third party to provide information about alleged wrongdoing, even if the third party isn\u2019t directly involved in the wrongdoing.\n\n>Reddit did not respond to a request for comment. Lawyers for both parties are expected to have another court date later this year. \n\n>Court to consider free speech, defamation. Ottawa-based lawyer Karin Page said the school board will have to demonstrate the user\u2019s comments were defamatory, rather than just critical of its policies. \n\n>Page said the court will need to balance the public interest in protecting anonymous speech against the board\u2019s need to defend itself against alleged defamation. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between someone just voicing their opposition to a policy or ... to the government, or to disclosing their own personal situations,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a distinction between that and making defamatory statements online.\u201d\n\n>She added the fact the comments named or identified specific individuals is concerning, as it makes it difficult for those people to defend themselves.",

Maybe ban the user if it is determined a defamation case against them would succeed beyond reasonable doubt. Reddit giving up information to a smaller non-us court would almost certainly set a precedent of giving up any info requested by a larger government that is being overrun by Nazis.

                "#Tragic Toll: Four Harris County Officers Take Their Own Lives in Just Six Weeks\n\nQuiet grief has settled over Harris County as the community reels from the shocking loss of four current and former deputies, each taking their own life in the space of just six weeks. The most recent was Deputy Christina Kohler, a well-respected veteran whose death last week was officially ruled a suicide. She was just 37.\n\nKohler had been reported missing, sparking concern across the force. A public alert was issued and the search began. Days later, on 13 March, her body was found. The news stunned friends and colleagues. Just three days after Kohler's death, former deputy Maria Vasquez, who left the sheriff's office in December, also died by apparent suicide. Then, earlier this week, another former deputy, William Bozeman, was found dead. The pattern is as heartbreaking as it is alarming.\n\n\u201cIt caught a lot of us by surprise,\u201d said Jose Lopez, president of the Harris County Deputies' Organisation. \u201cOne is too many. Two? Three? Yes, it's devastating.\u201d\n\nLopez, who had known two of the fallen deputies for over twenty years, has been helping colleagues come to terms with the grief. He\u2019s also grappling with the death of former deputy Long Nguyen, who took his own life in early February at the age of 58. For Lopez, the pain is personal. For the department, it\u2019s a wake-up call.\n\nThere is growing concern about the toll this profession takes on those who serve. Policing is a job that deals daily with trauma, danger and confrontation. It can grind away at a person\u2019s mental health until there is very little left to give. Dr Thomas McNeese, who heads up the Sheriff's Office Behavioural Health Division, is all too aware of the emotional weight deputies carry. His team offers peer-to-peer support and has been working since 2020 to provide help, but even he admits the past few weeks have been especially hard.\n\n\u201cThis profession takes a toll,\u201d said McNeese. \u201cThe longer you're in it, the more it changes you.\u201d\n\nLaw enforcement officers have long been known to suffer disproportionately from mental health issues and suicide. The nature of the work, the things they witness, the pressure to remain composed in the face of chaos, it all builds up. McNeese is urging those who are struggling to reach out, to talk, to act.\n\n\u201cGetting help, doing something to not stay stuck, that\u2019s important,\u201d he said.\n\nInside the department, questions are being asked. Despite the resources already in place, Lopez wonders if it is enough. Is there more they could be doing? Is something being missed?\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t help but ask,\u201d he said. \u201cDo we need to take a different approach?\u201d",

You can find more details here.\n\nKatie Johnson\u2019s deposition was part of her lawsuit against Donald Trump, which was filed in federal court in Riverside, California, in April 2016.

However, the case was dismissed shortly after it was filed. You can find more details here.\n\nKatie Johnson\u2019s lawsuit against Donald Trump was dismissed because the judge ruled that the complaint didn\u2019t raise valid claims under federal law. Additionally, there were legal hurdles, such as the statute of limitations on many of the claims, including sexual misconduct, assault, and battery. The case was dismissed in May 2016, and subsequent versions of the lawsuit were also withdrawn or dismissed.\n\nKatie Johnson\u2019s lawsuit against Donald Trump was withdrawn because she reportedly received threats and was too afraid to continue with the case. Her attorney, Lisa Bloom, mentioned that Johnson was too frightened to appear at a scheduled news conference. The case was ultimately dropped without further explanation.\n\nThe following is a portion of her deposition. It is graphic and troubling.\n\nhttps://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4154484/katie-johnson-v-donald-j-trump/\n\n9. On the first occasion involving the Defendant, Donald J. Trump, the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, was forced to manually stimulate Defendant Trump with the use of her hand upon Defendant Trump\u2019s erect penis until he reached sexual orgasm.\n\n10. On the second occasion involving the Defendant, Donald J. Trump, the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, was forced to orally copulate Defendant Trump by placing her mouth upon Defendant Trump\u2019s erect penis until he reached sexual orgasm.\n\n11. On the third occasion involving the Defendant, Donald J. Trump, the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson was forced to engage in an unnatural lesbian sex act with her fellow minor and sex slave, Maria Doe age 12, for the sexual enjoyment of Defendant Trump. After this sex act, both minors were forced to orally copulate Defendant Trump by placing their mouths simultaneously on his erect penis until he achieved sexual orgasm. After zipping up his pants, Defendant Trump physically pushed both minors away while angrily berating them for the \u201cpoor\u201d quality of their sexual performance.\n\n12. On the fourth and final sexual encounter with the Defendant, Donald J. Trump, the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, was tied to a bed by Defendant Trump who then proceeded to forcibly rape Plaintiff Johnson. During the course of this savage sexual attack, Plaintiff Johnson loudly pleaded with Defendant Trump to \u201cplease wear a condom\u201d. Defendant Trump responded by violently striking Plaintiff Johnson in the face with his open hand and screaming that \u201che would do whatever he wanted\u201d as he refused to wear protection. After achieving sexual orgasm, the Defendant, Donald J. Trump put his suit back on and when the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, in tears asked Defendant Trump what would happen if he had impregnated her, Defendant Trump grabbed his wallet and threw some money at her and screamed that she should use the money \u201cto get a fucking abortion\u201d.\n\n13. On the first occasion involving the Defendant, Jeffrey E. Epstein, the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, was forced to disrobe into her bra and panties and to give a full body massage to Defendant Epstein while he was completely naked. During the massage, Defendant Epstein physically forced Plaintiff Johnson to touch his erect penis with her bare hands and to clean up his ejaculated semen after he achieved sexual orgasm.\n\n14. On the second occasion involving the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson was again forced to disrobe into her bra and panties while giving Defendant Epstein a full body massage while he was completely naked. The Defendant, Donald J. Trump, was also present as he was getting his own massage from another minor, Jane Doe, age 13, Defendant Epstein forced Plaintiff Johnson to touch his erect penis by physically placing her bare hands upon his sex organ and again forced Plaintiff Johnson to clean up his ejaculated semen after he achieved sexual orgasm.\n\n15. Shortly after this sexual assault by the Defendant, Jeffrey E. Epstein, on the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, Plaintiff Johnson was still present while the two Defendants were arguing over who would be the one to take Plaintiff Johnson\u2019s virginity. The Defendant, Donald J. Trump, was clearly heard referring to Defendant, Jeffrey E. Epstein, as a \u201cJew Bastard\u201d as he yelled at Defendant Epstein, that clearly, he, Defendant Trump, should be the lucky one to \u201cpop the cherry\u201d of Plaintiff Johnson.\n\n16. The third and final sexual assault by the Defendant, Jeffrey E. Epstein, on the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, took place after Plaintiff Johnson had been brutally and savagely raped by Defendant Trump. While receiving another full body massage from Plaintiff Johnson, while in the nude, Defendant Epstein became so enraged after finding out that Defendant Trump had been the one to take Plaintiff Johnson\u2019s virginity, that Defendant Epstein also violently raped Plaintiff Johnson. After forcing Plaintiff Johnson to disrobe into her bra and panties, while receiving a massage from the Plaintiff, Defendant Epstein attempted to enter Plaintiff Johnson\u2019s anal cavity with his erect penis while trying to restrain her. Plaintiff Johnson attempted to push Defendant Epstein away, at which time Defendant Epstein attempted to enter Plaintiff Johnson\u2019s vagina with his erect penis. This attempt to brutally sodomize and rape Plaintiff Johnson by Defendant Epstein was finally repelled by Plaintiff Johnson but not before Defendant Epstein was able to achieve sexual orgasm. After perversely sodomizing and raping the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, the Defendant, Jeffrey E. Epstein, attempted to strike her about the head with his closed fists while he angrily screamed at Plaintiff Johnson that he, Defendant Epstein, should have been the one who \u201ctook her cherry, not Mr. Trump\u201d, before she finally managed to break away from Defendant Epstein.\n\n17. The Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, was fully warned on more than one occasion by both Defendants, Donald J. Trump and Jeffrey E. Epstein, that were she ever to reveal any of the details of the sexual and physical abuse that she had suffered as a sex slave for Defendant Trump and Defendant Epstein, that Plaintiff Johnson and her family would be in mortal danger. Plaintiff Johnson was warned that this would mean certain death for herself and Plaintiff Johnson\u2019s family unless she remained silent forever on the exact details of the depraved and perverted sexual and physical abuse she had been forced to endure from the Defendants.\n\nTiffany Doe Declaration | T\u00e9l\u00e9charger gratuitement PDF | Rape | Violence (scribd.com)",

                "From The CBC:\n\n>The Ottawa-Carleton District School Board (OCDSB) is locked in a court battle to compel social media site Reddit to turn over identifying information of a user who it alleges has been defaming staff at a local elementary school.\n\n>The board alleges the posts about ongoing issues at Pinecrest Public School were made in an attempt to defame employees \u201cfor some unknown ulterior motive.\u201d None of the allegations have been proven in court.\n\n>The board wants Reddit to provide any email addresses, phone numbers, location data and other identifying information about the user. In a statement, it said it was compelled by its \u201cunwavering dedication to creating a positive and supportive environment for all members of the OCDSB community.\u201d\n\n>Reddit argues handing over the information will create a chill among other users, explaining in its court filings that \u201canonymity is not just a user preference but a defining feature of Reddit\u2019s business model and identity.\u201d\n\n>Most of the comments in question were in response to discussions around news stories about the board and problems at specific schools. Several involved specific incidents and ongoing issues at Pinecrest Public School that have been reported in the media.\n\n>Some of the comments singled out the school\u2019s principal and a superintendent, the board said in its court filings. Reddit\u2019s court filings mention 51 comments by the user in 17 different conversations. \n\n>User alleged OCDSB failed to report violence, racism. According to the OCDSB, the \u201cfalse and defamatory\u201d comments began on Dec. 17, 2022. Naming individual staff members, the user accused them of failing to report incidents, stifling investigations and ignoring instances of racism.\n\n>According to the board, the comments were dishonest, disrespectful and created a toxic work environment. The anonymous user also insinuated that staff members had \u201cacquiesced in the perpetration of racist acts at the school,\u201d the board said.\n\n>During a lengthy Reddit thread about a high school [student who died after being stabbed in Nepean](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/high-school-student-stabbed-last-week-in-nepean-dies-1.7194798) last May, the user accused an OCDSB superintendent of ignoring safety concerns in the district. In a response to another user, the individual being sought by the board described themselves as a teacher. \n\n>The board said it\u2019s considering a defamation lawsuit against the person responsible for posting the comments. But Reddit denies OCDSB\u2019s claim that the information is \u201cnecessary for it to determine whether to pursue a potential claim for defamation.\u201d\n\n>OCDSB \u2018vigorously defending\u2019 employees. In response to CBC\u2019s request for comment, OCDSB communications manager Diane Pernari said the board is committed to \u201cvigorously defending our employees against unfounded attacks and upholding our legal and ethical obligations.\u201d\n\n>She wrote the legal action underscores the board\u2019s \u201cunwavering dedication to creating a positive and supportive environment for all members of the OCDSB community.\u201d Known as a Norwich Order, the board\u2019s application seeks to compel a third party to provide information about alleged wrongdoing, even if the third party isn\u2019t directly involved in the wrongdoing.\n\n>Reddit did not respond to a request for comment. Lawyers for both parties are expected to have another court date later this year. \n\n>Court to consider free speech, defamation. Ottawa-based lawyer Karin Page said the school board will have to demonstrate the user\u2019s comments were defamatory, rather than just critical of its policies. \n\n>Page said the court will need to balance the public interest in protecting anonymous speech against the board\u2019s need to defend itself against alleged defamation. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between someone just voicing their opposition to a policy or ... to the government, or to disclosing their own personal situations,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a distinction between that and making defamatory statements online.\u201d\n\n>She added the fact the comments named or identified specific individuals is concerning, as it makes it difficult for those people to defend themselves.",

                "#Tragic Toll: Four Harris County Officers Take Their Own Lives in Just Six Weeks\n\nQuiet grief has settled over Harris County as the community reels from the shocking loss of four current and former deputies, each taking their own life in the space of just six weeks. The most recent was Deputy Christina Kohler, a well-respected veteran whose death last week was officially ruled a suicide. She was just 37.\n\nKohler had been reported missing, sparking concern across the force. A public alert was issued and the search began. Days later, on 13 March, her body was found. The news stunned friends and colleagues. Just three days after Kohler's death, former deputy Maria Vasquez, who left the sheriff's office in December, also died by apparent suicide. Then, earlier this week, another former deputy, William Bozeman, was found dead. The pattern is as heartbreaking as it is alarming.\n\n\u201cIt caught a lot of us by surprise,\u201d said Jose Lopez, president of the Harris County Deputies' Organisation. \u201cOne is too many. Two? Three? Yes, it's devastating.\u201d\n\nLopez, who had known two of the fallen deputies for over twenty years, has been helping colleagues come to terms with the grief. He\u2019s also grappling with the death of former deputy Long Nguyen, who took his own life in early February at the age of 58. For Lopez, the pain is personal. For the department, it\u2019s a wake-up call.\n\nThere is growing concern about the toll this profession takes on those who serve. Policing is a job that deals daily with trauma, danger and confrontation. It can grind away at a person\u2019s mental health until there is very little left to give. Dr Thomas McNeese, who heads up the Sheriff's Office Behavioural Health Division, is all too aware of the emotional weight deputies carry. His team offers peer-to-peer support and has been working since 2020 to provide help, but even he admits the past few weeks have been especially hard.\n\n\u201cThis profession takes a toll,\u201d said McNeese. \u201cThe longer you're in it, the more it changes you.\u201d\n\nLaw enforcement officers have long been known to suffer disproportionately from mental health issues and suicide. The nature of the work, the things they witness, the pressure to remain composed in the face of chaos, it all builds up. McNeese is urging those who are struggling to reach out, to talk, to act.\n\n\u201cGetting help, doing something to not stay stuck, that\u2019s important,\u201d he said.\n\nInside the department, questions are being asked. Despite the resources already in place, Lopez wonders if it is enough. Is there more they could be doing? Is something being missed?\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t help but ask,\u201d he said. \u201cDo we need to take a different approach?\u201d",

                "This isn\u2019t redacted.\n\nFrom copilot:\n\nKatie Johnson filed a lawsuit against Donald Trump, alleging that he raped her when she was 13 years old. The case was dismissed almost a decade ago. The lawsuit claimed that the assaults happened at parties hosted by Jeffrey Epstein. You can find more details here.\n\nKatie Johnson\u2019s deposition was part of her lawsuit against Donald Trump, which was filed in federal court in Riverside, California, in April 2016. The lawsuit named Trump and Jeffrey Epstein as defendants and claimed that they held Johnson as a \u201csex slave\u201d and assaulted her when she was 13 years old. However, the case was dismissed shortly after it was filed. You can find more details here.\n\nKatie Johnson\u2019s lawsuit against Donald Trump was dismissed because the judge ruled that the complaint didn\u2019t raise valid claims under federal law. Additionally, there were legal hurdles, such as the statute of limitations on many of the claims, including sexual misconduct, assault, and battery. The case was dismissed in May 2016, and subsequent versions of the lawsuit were also withdrawn or dismissed.\n\nKatie Johnson\u2019s lawsuit against Donald Trump was withdrawn because she reportedly received threats and was too afraid to continue with the case. Her attorney, Lisa Bloom, mentioned that Johnson was too frightened to appear at a scheduled news conference. The case was ultimately dropped without further explanation.\n\nThe following is a portion of her deposition. It is graphic and troubling.\n\nhttps://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4154484/katie-johnson-v-donald-j-trump/\n\n9. On the first occasion involving the Defendant, Donald J. Trump, the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, was forced to manually stimulate Defendant Trump with the use of her hand upon Defendant Trump\u2019s erect penis until he reached sexual orgasm.\n\n10. On the second occasion involving the Defendant, Donald J. Trump, the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, was forced to orally copulate Defendant Trump by placing her mouth upon Defendant Trump\u2019s erect penis until he reached sexual orgasm.\n\n11. On the third occasion involving the Defendant, Donald J. Trump, the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson was forced to engage in an unnatural lesbian sex act with her fellow minor and sex slave, Maria Doe age 12, for the sexual enjoyment of Defendant Trump. After this sex act, both minors were forced to orally copulate Defendant Trump by placing their mouths simultaneously on his erect penis until he achieved sexual orgasm. After zipping up his pants, Defendant Trump physically pushed both minors away while angrily berating them for the \u201cpoor\u201d quality of their sexual performance.\n\n12. On the fourth and final sexual encounter with the Defendant, Donald J. Trump, the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, was tied to a bed by Defendant Trump who then proceeded to forcibly rape Plaintiff Johnson. During the course of this savage sexual attack, Plaintiff Johnson loudly pleaded with Defendant Trump to \u201cplease wear a condom\u201d. Defendant Trump responded by violently striking Plaintiff Johnson in the face with his open hand and screaming that \u201che would do whatever he wanted\u201d as he refused to wear protection. After achieving sexual orgasm, the Defendant, Donald J. Trump put his suit back on and when the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, in tears asked Defendant Trump what would happen if he had impregnated her, Defendant Trump grabbed his wallet and threw some money at her and screamed that she should use the money \u201cto get a fucking abortion\u201d.\n\n13. On the first occasion involving the Defendant, Jeffrey E. Epstein, the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, was forced to disrobe into her bra and panties and to give a full body massage to Defendant Epstein while he was completely naked. During the massage, Defendant Epstein physically forced Plaintiff Johnson to touch his erect penis with her bare hands and to clean up his ejaculated semen after he achieved sexual orgasm.\n\n14. On the second occasion involving the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson was again forced to disrobe into her bra and panties while giving Defendant Epstein a full body massage while he was completely naked. The Defendant, Donald J. Trump, was also present as he was getting his own massage from another minor, Jane Doe, age 13, Defendant Epstein forced Plaintiff Johnson to touch his erect penis by physically placing her bare hands upon his sex organ and again forced Plaintiff Johnson to clean up his ejaculated semen after he achieved sexual orgasm.\n\n15. Shortly after this sexual assault by the Defendant, Jeffrey E. Epstein, on the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, Plaintiff Johnson was still present while the two Defendants were arguing over who would be the one to take Plaintiff Johnson\u2019s virginity. The Defendant, Donald J. Trump, was clearly heard referring to Defendant, Jeffrey E. Epstein, as a \u201cJew Bastard\u201d as he yelled at Defendant Epstein, that clearly, he, Defendant Trump, should be the lucky one to \u201cpop the cherry\u201d of Plaintiff Johnson.\n\n16. The third and final sexual assault by the Defendant, Jeffrey E. Epstein, on the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, took place after Plaintiff Johnson had been brutally and savagely raped by Defendant Trump. While receiving another full body massage from Plaintiff Johnson, while in the nude, Defendant Epstein became so enraged after finding out that Defendant Trump had been the one to take Plaintiff Johnson\u2019s virginity, that Defendant Epstein also violently raped Plaintiff Johnson. After forcing Plaintiff Johnson to disrobe into her bra and panties, while receiving a massage from the Plaintiff, Defendant Epstein attempted to enter Plaintiff Johnson\u2019s anal cavity with his erect penis while trying to restrain her. Plaintiff Johnson attempted to push Defendant Epstein away, at which time Defendant Epstein attempted to enter Plaintiff Johnson\u2019s vagina with his erect penis. This attempt to brutally sodomize and rape Plaintiff Johnson by Defendant Epstein was finally repelled by Plaintiff Johnson but not before Defendant Epstein was able to achieve sexual orgasm. After perversely sodomizing and raping the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, the Defendant, Jeffrey E. Epstein, attempted to strike her about the head with his closed fists while he angrily screamed at Plaintiff Johnson that he, Defendant Epstein, should have been the one who \u201ctook her cherry, not Mr. Trump\u201d, before she finally managed to break away from Defendant Epstein.\n\n17. The Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, was fully warned on more than one occasion by both Defendants, Donald J. Trump and Jeffrey E. Epstein, that were she ever to reveal any of the details of the sexual and physical abuse that she had suffered as a sex slave for Defendant Trump and Defendant Epstein, that Plaintiff Johnson and her family would be in mortal danger. Plaintiff Johnson was warned that this would mean certain death for herself and Plaintiff Johnson\u2019s family unless she remained silent forever on the exact details of the depraved and perverted sexual and physical abuse she had been forced to endure from the Defendants.\n\nTiffany Doe Declaration | T\u00e9l\u00e9charger gratuitement PDF | Rape | Violence (scribd.com)",

In a statement, it said it was compelled by its \u201cunwavering dedication to creating a positive and supportive environment for all members of the OCDSB community.\u201d\n\n>Reddit argues handing over the information will create a chill among other users, explaining in its court filings that \u201canonymity is not just a user preference but a defining feature of Reddit\u2019s business model and identity.\u201d\n\n>Most of the comments in question were in response to discussions around news stories about the board and problems at specific schools. Several involved specific incidents and ongoing issues at Pinecrest Public School that have been reported in the media.\n\n>Some of the comments singled out the school\u2019s principal and a superintendent, the board said in its court filings. Reddit\u2019s court filings mention 51 comments by the user in 17 different conversations. \n\n>User alleged OCDSB failed to report violence, racism. According to the OCDSB, the \u201cfalse and defamatory\u201d comments began on Dec. 17, 2022. Naming individual staff members, the user accused them of failing to report incidents, stifling investigations and ignoring instances of racism.\n\n>According to the board, the comments were dishonest, disrespectful and created a toxic work environment. The anonymous user also insinuated that staff members had \u201cacquiesced in the perpetration of racist acts at the school,\u201d the board said.\n\n>During a lengthy Reddit thread about a high school [student who died after being stabbed in Nepean](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/high-school-student-stabbed-last-week-in-nepean-dies-1.7194798) last May, the user accused an OCDSB superintendent of ignoring safety concerns in the district.

In response to CBC\u2019s request for comment, OCDSB communications manager Diane Pernari said the board is committed to \u201cvigorously defending our employees against unfounded attacks and upholding our legal and ethical obligations.\u201d\n\n>She wrote the legal action underscores the board\u2019s \u201cunwavering dedication to creating a positive and supportive environment for all members of the OCDSB community.\u201d Known as a Norwich Order, the board\u2019s application seeks to compel a third party to provide information about alleged wrongdoing, even if the third party isn\u2019t directly involved in the wrongdoing.\n\n>Reddit did not respond to a request for comment. Lawyers for both parties are expected to have another court date later this year. \n\n>Court to consider free speech, defamation. Ottawa-based lawyer Karin Page said the school board will have to demonstrate the user\u2019s comments were defamatory, rather than just critical of its policies. \n\n>Page said the court will need to balance the public interest in protecting anonymous speech against the board\u2019s need to defend itself against alleged defamation. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between someone just voicing their opposition to a policy or ... to the government, or to disclosing their own personal situations,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a distinction between that and making defamatory statements online.\u201d\n\n>She added the fact the comments named or identified specific individuals is concerning, as it makes it difficult for those people to defend themselves.",

                "#Tragic Toll: Four Harris County Officers Take Their Own Lives in Just Six Weeks\n\nQuiet grief has settled over Harris County as the community reels from the shocking loss of four current and former deputies, each taking their own life in the space of just six weeks. The most recent was Deputy Christina Kohler, a well-respected veteran whose death last week was officially ruled a suicide. She was just 37.\n\nKohler had been reported missing, sparking concern across the force. A public alert was issued and the search began. Days later, on 13 March, her body was found. The news stunned friends and colleagues. Just three days after Kohler's death, former deputy Maria Vasquez, who left the sheriff's office in December, also died by apparent suicide. Then, earlier this week, another former deputy, William Bozeman, was found dead. The pattern is as heartbreaking as it is alarming.\n\n\u201cIt caught a lot of us by surprise,\u201d said Jose Lopez, president of the Harris County Deputies' Organisation. \u201cOne is too many. Two? Three? Yes, it's devastating.\u201d\n\nLopez, who had known two of the fallen deputies for over twenty years, has been helping colleagues come to terms with the grief. He\u2019s also grappling with the death of former deputy Long Nguyen, who took his own life in early February at the age of 58. For Lopez, the pain is personal. For the department, it\u2019s a wake-up call.\n\nThere is growing concern about the toll this profession takes on those who serve. Policing is a job that deals daily with trauma, danger and confrontation. It can grind away at a person\u2019s mental health until there is very little left to give. Dr Thomas McNeese, who heads up the Sheriff's Office Behavioural Health Division, is all too aware of the emotional weight deputies carry. His team offers peer-to-peer support and has been working since 2020 to provide help, but even he admits the past few weeks have been especially hard.\n\n\u201cThis profession takes a toll,\u201d said McNeese. \u201cThe longer you're in it, the more it changes you.\u201d\n\nLaw enforcement officers have long been known to suffer disproportionately from mental health issues and suicide. The nature of the work, the things they witness, the pressure to remain composed in the face of chaos, it all builds up. McNeese is urging those who are struggling to reach out, to talk, to act.\n\n\u201cGetting help, doing something to not stay stuck, that\u2019s important,\u201d he said.\n\nInside the department, questions are being asked. Despite the resources already in place, Lopez wonders if it is enough. Is there more they could be doing? Is something being missed?\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t help but ask,\u201d he said. \u201cDo we need to take a different approach?\u201d",

That is a rapid way to get numbers. The numbers from that policy, and the videos of illegal immigrants being treated inhumanly feeds his sociopath base.\n\nIt should be noted, a lot of posts have been saying, \u201cIs this what you voted for!?\u201d In regards to Cubans seeing Cubans being deported and such. You need to understand: This IS exactly what they voted for. Legal immigrants do not give a shit about their brethren who are not legal. All they see are \u201cillegals\u201d being kicked out of THEIR country that they \u201cearned\u201d.
