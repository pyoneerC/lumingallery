This tip is especially crucial for events with thousands of attendees like concerts or sporting events.\n\nWhen the roof crumbled, panic likely set in fast. Yet survivors credit the staff's swift action to evacuate them as key. If you're ever caught in a similar situation, stay calm and follow any instructions given by event staff immediately."
