The contracts were routinely altered, however, to make it impossible to actually pay off that land, creating a cycle of permanent debt slavery. It wasn't until reformers from the North started opening Black schools, and the people became educated, that African Americans were able to read and understand the contracts they were signing, seek legal counsel, find representation in Washington, etc. In other words, slavery doesn't end with an amendment.

                ">China shares a border and close ties with Myanmar. Chinese rescuers had their first success Sunday, fewer than 48 hours after the quake, when they joined hands with local people to pull an elderly man from a badly damaged hospital in the capital city of Naypyitaw.\n\n>By Wednesday, Chinese rescuers had pulled out nine survivors, including a pregnant woman and a child. In Mandalay, Chinese rescuers saved a 52-year-old man who trapped for nearly 125 hours.\n\nFor an administration that talks plenty about countering China, shit like this is boneheaded. In these developing countries, when a more pro-China and a more pro-US candidate are going head to head voters are gonna remember it was the Chinese saving them when disasters stuck.",
