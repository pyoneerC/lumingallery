It seems somewhat unnecessary to me, as Ukraine doesn't really have enough jets where lack of jet fuel would make a noticeable difference in the war, but what do I know, I'm no military analysist. Also if it was really Putin, why not hire a non-russian to do it? Unless he was sending some sort of message? Who knows.

It is possible that this was sabotage aimed at preventing that from happening. I'm not saying that this is what happened, but there is a possibility. It seems somewhat unnecessary to me, as Ukraine doesn't really have enough jets where lack of jet fuel would make a noticeable difference in the war, but what do I know, I'm no military analysist. Also if it was really Putin, why not hire a non-russian to do it? Unless he was sending some sort of message? Who knows. But, it's kind of weird for a Russian ship master to randomly hit a stationary tanker that just happened to be carrying fuel heading for Ukraine... a pretty remarkable coincidence.\n\nJust watched a youtube video covering topic (at the 6:00 mark) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcRLQwpBc1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcRLQwpBc1s)\n\nWas curious what kinda responses I'd get here.",
