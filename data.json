Here\u2019s what we know\n\nAt least two people were killed and about 20 injured when a Mexican Navy training ship on a global goodwill tour struck the underside of the Brooklyn Bridge in New York Saturday night, officials said.\n\nThere were 277 people on the sailing ship, called the Cuauht\u00e9moc, at the time of the incident and everyone is believed to be accounted for, officials said Saturday\n\n[Related live-story: 2 dead after Mexican Navy training ship carrying more than 200 people strikes underside of Brooklyn Bridge](https://archive.is/o/fVtpJ/https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/brooklyn-bridge-mexican-navy-ship-05-18-25-hnk)\n\nDramatic video shows the Cuauht\u00e9moc\u2019s masts hitting the underside of the bridge and breaking as the vessel passes underneath, with pieces falling down toward the deck.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know:\n\n**What happened**\n\nThe incident occurred around 8:20 p.m. local time as the ship was departing from New York\u2019s Pier 17, where it had been docked at the South Street Seaport Museum for five days of public viewing.\n\nThe ship\u2019s masts \u2013 bedecked in lights - struck the bridge, breaking on impact and sending debris falling onto the vessel\u2019s deck.\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams said the ship lost power. City officials earlier said \u201cmechanical issues\u201d may have caused the incident, but cautioned all information so far is preliminary. An investigation is ongoing.\n\nThe New York Fire Department said in an email to CNN it received the call that a ship had struck the bridge around 8:39 p.m. More than 100 fire and emergency medical service personnel responded to the scene, NYFD said in its email.\n\nVideo of the Mexican Navy training ship shortly after it struck the Brooklyn Bridge showed people hanging from at least one of its masts. On tall ships like the Cuauht\u00e9moc, it is a ceremonial tradition for sailors to climb the masts and rigging when departing or arriving into harbor.\n\n\u201cWe could see some people being kind of dragged,\u201d an eyewitness, Flavio Moreira, told CNN. \u201cI believe it was some of the staff, they were on the top of the boat. And they were swinging around, back and forth as soon as the ship hit the bridge.\u201d\n\n**Multiple killed**\n\nTwo people were killed and two remain in critical condition, Adams said. The two who died fell from one of the ship\u2019s masts, the law enforcement official told CNN. They were pronounced dead after being taken to a nearby hospital, the official said.\n\n\u201cAt this time, of the 277 on board, 19 sustained injuries, 2 of which remain in critical condition, and 2 more have sadly passed away from their injuries,\u201d Adams\u00a0[wrote on X](https://archive.is/o/fVtpJ/https://x.com/NYCMayor/status/1923956324737351832).\n\nThe Mexican Navy said earlier a total of 22 people were injured, 19 of whom were taken to hospitals.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said the two people killed were crew members and sent her condolences to their families.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply saddened by the loss of two crew members of the Cuauht\u00e9moc Training Ship, who lost their lives in the unfortunate accident in New York Harbor. Our sympathy and support go out to their families,\u201d Sheinbaum said in a post on X early Sunday.\n\nSheinbaum said the Mexican Navy is supporting those injured in the incident, and that the Mexican ambassador to the United States and Mexican Consulate General were supporting the navy.\n\n**An investigation underway**\n\nThe ship appeared to lose power around 8:20 p.m. as the captain was maneuvering the ship, which forced the vessel toward the bridge\u2019s pillar and the ship\u2019s mast struck the bridge, New York Police Department Chief Wilson Aramboles said at a news conference Saturday.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board is conducting an investigation.\n\nMexican authorities described the Cuauht\u00e9moc ship as a steel-hulled three-masted barque with a length of around 300 feet and a height of roughly 160 feet, a 2024\u00a0[news release](https://archive.is/o/fVtpJ/https://sailleeuwin.com/news-stories/cuauhtemoc-press-release-australia-nz-2024/)\u00a0from one of its training cruises said.\n\nGovernment\u00a0[documents](https://archive.is/o/fVtpJ/https://nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/publications/coast-pilot/files/cp2/CPB2_C09_WEB.pdf)\u00a0show the Brooklyn Bridge has a navigational clearance of 127 feet, roughly 30 feet shorter than the height of the sailing ship.\n\nThere was no visible damage to the Brooklyn Bridge, which appeared to be left structurally intact.\n\n\u201cWhile inspections will remain ongoing, there are no signs of structural damage to the Brooklyn Bridge,\u201d NY Department of Transportation said in a\u00a0[post](https://archive.is/o/fVtpJ/https://x.com/NYC_DOT/status/1923934086554349869)\u00a0on X.\n\nTraffic was temporarily closed in both directions for about 40 minutes as emergency services responded to the scene. It was later reopened following a preliminary inspection, Adams said.\n\nThis ship has been moved to Manhattan\u2019s Pier 36, located along the East River less than a mile from the Brooklyn Bridge, according to the law enforcement official.\n\n**What do we know about the ship?**\n\nThe Cuauht\u00e9moc is a training sailing ship of the Mexican Navy and described by officials as a diplomatic symbol of Mexico abroad.\n\nKnown as the \u201cAmbassador and Knight of the Seas,\u201d the ship was in New York as part of a global goodwill tour and was en route to Iceland at the time of the incident.\n\nA spokesperson for the New York City-area\u00a0[Sail4th 250](https://archive.is/o/fVtpJ/https://www.sail4th.org/)\u00a0events told CNN that the Cuauht\u00e9moc ship had \u201cwelcomed dignitaries and media\u201d as part of its New York stop on its global tour.\n\nThe sailing ship was expected to join the parade of international tall ships to celebrate the United States\u2019s 250 anniversary on July 4, 2026 \u2013 in what the event is calling \u201cthe largest-ever flotilla of tall ships from around the world.\n\n\u201dBuilt in Spain in 1981, the ship was acquired by the Mexican Navy to train cadets and officers.

This is what everyone against the cuts was warning about.\n\nI want to edit to add that the Jackson, KY NWS personnel did the best they could. There were some staff present, but according to them, it was 4-5 people short of being ideal, again because of the funding cuts. I imagine burnout on nights like this is unavoidable.

Here\u2019s what we know\n\nAt least two people were killed and about 20 injured when a Mexican Navy training ship on a global goodwill tour struck the underside of the Brooklyn Bridge in New York Saturday night, officials said.\n\nThere were 277 people on the sailing ship, called the Cuauht\u00e9moc, at the time of the incident and everyone is believed to be accounted for, officials said Saturday\n\n[Related live-story: 2 dead after Mexican Navy training ship carrying more than 200 people strikes underside of Brooklyn Bridge](https://archive.is/o/fVtpJ/https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/brooklyn-bridge-mexican-navy-ship-05-18-25-hnk)\n\nDramatic video shows the Cuauht\u00e9moc\u2019s masts hitting the underside of the bridge and breaking as the vessel passes underneath, with pieces falling down toward the deck.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know:\n\n**What happened**\n\nThe incident occurred around 8:20 p.m. local time as the ship was departing from New York\u2019s Pier 17, where it had been docked at the South Street Seaport Museum for five days of public viewing.\n\nThe ship\u2019s masts \u2013 bedecked in lights - struck the bridge, breaking on impact and sending debris falling onto the vessel\u2019s deck.\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams said the ship lost power. City officials earlier said \u201cmechanical issues\u201d may have caused the incident, but cautioned all information so far is preliminary. An investigation is ongoing.\n\nThe New York Fire Department said in an email to CNN it received the call that a ship had struck the bridge around 8:39 p.m. More than 100 fire and emergency medical service personnel responded to the scene, NYFD said in its email.\n\nVideo of the Mexican Navy training ship shortly after it struck the Brooklyn Bridge showed people hanging from at least one of its masts. On tall ships like the Cuauht\u00e9moc, it is a ceremonial tradition for sailors to climb the masts and rigging when departing or arriving into harbor.\n\n\u201cWe could see some people being kind of dragged,\u201d an eyewitness, Flavio Moreira, told CNN. \u201cI believe it was some of the staff, they were on the top of the boat. And they were swinging around, back and forth as soon as the ship hit the bridge.\u201d\n\n**Multiple killed**\n\nTwo people were killed and two remain in critical condition, Adams said. The two who died fell from one of the ship\u2019s masts, the law enforcement official told CNN. They were pronounced dead after being taken to a nearby hospital, the official said.\n\n\u201cAt this time, of the 277 on board, 19 sustained injuries, 2 of which remain in critical condition, and 2 more have sadly passed away from their injuries,\u201d Adams\u00a0[wrote on X](https://archive.is/o/fVtpJ/https://x.com/NYCMayor/status/1923956324737351832).\n\nThe Mexican Navy said earlier a total of 22 people were injured, 19 of whom were taken to hospitals.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said the two people killed were crew members and sent her condolences to their families.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply saddened by the loss of two crew members of the Cuauht\u00e9moc Training Ship, who lost their lives in the unfortunate accident in New York Harbor. Our sympathy and support go out to their families,\u201d Sheinbaum said in a post on X early Sunday.\n\nSheinbaum said the Mexican Navy is supporting those injured in the incident, and that the Mexican ambassador to the United States and Mexican Consulate General were supporting the navy.\n\n**An investigation underway**\n\nThe ship appeared to lose power around 8:20 p.m. as the captain was maneuvering the ship, which forced the vessel toward the bridge\u2019s pillar and the ship\u2019s mast struck the bridge, New York Police Department Chief Wilson Aramboles said at a news conference Saturday.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board is conducting an investigation.\n\nMexican authorities described the Cuauht\u00e9moc ship as a steel-hulled three-masted barque with a length of around 300 feet and a height of roughly 160 feet, a 2024\u00a0[news release](https://archive.is/o/fVtpJ/https://sailleeuwin.com/news-stories/cuauhtemoc-press-release-australia-nz-2024/)\u00a0from one of its training cruises said.\n\nGovernment\u00a0[documents](https://archive.is/o/fVtpJ/https://nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/publications/coast-pilot/files/cp2/CPB2_C09_WEB.pdf)\u00a0show the Brooklyn Bridge has a navigational clearance of 127 feet, roughly 30 feet shorter than the height of the sailing ship.\n\nThere was no visible damage to the Brooklyn Bridge, which appeared to be left structurally intact.\n\n\u201cWhile inspections will remain ongoing, there are no signs of structural damage to the Brooklyn Bridge,\u201d NY Department of Transportation said in a\u00a0[post](https://archive.is/o/fVtpJ/https://x.com/NYC_DOT/status/1923934086554349869)\u00a0on X.\n\nTraffic was temporarily closed in both directions for about 40 minutes as emergency services responded to the scene. It was later reopened following a preliminary inspection, Adams said.\n\nThis ship has been moved to Manhattan\u2019s Pier 36, located along the East River less than a mile from the Brooklyn Bridge, according to the law enforcement official.\n\n**What do we know about the ship?**\n\nThe Cuauht\u00e9moc is a training sailing ship of the Mexican Navy and described by officials as a diplomatic symbol of Mexico abroad.\n\nKnown as the \u201cAmbassador and Knight of the Seas,\u201d the ship was in New York as part of a global goodwill tour and was en route to Iceland at the time of the incident.\n\nA spokesperson for the New York City-area\u00a0[Sail4th 250](https://archive.is/o/fVtpJ/https://www.sail4th.org/)\u00a0events told CNN that the Cuauht\u00e9moc ship had \u201cwelcomed dignitaries and media\u201d as part of its New York stop on its global tour.\n\nThe sailing ship was expected to join the parade of international tall ships to celebrate the United States\u2019s 250 anniversary on July 4, 2026 \u2013 in what the event is calling \u201cthe largest-ever flotilla of tall ships from around the world.\n\n\u201dBuilt in Spain in 1981, the ship was acquired by the Mexican Navy to train cadets and officers. It regularly takes part in major regattas around the world. According to a\u00a0[news release\u00a0](https://archive.is/o/fVtpJ/https://sailleeuwin.com/news-stories/cuauhtemoc-press-release-australia-nz-2024/)from one of its global cruises, it was used for training by the Heroic Naval Military School, an elite military academy in Mexico.\n\nThe ship, as of last year, had visited 212 ports in 64 countries with 756,085 nautical miles sailed, the latter equivalent to making 35 trips around the world, the release said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.",

Here\u2019s what we know\n\nAt least two people were killed and about 20 injured when a Mexican Navy training ship on a global goodwill tour struck the underside of the Brooklyn Bridge in New York Saturday night, officials said.\n\nThere were 277 people on the sailing ship, called the Cuauht\u00e9moc, at the time of the incident and everyone is believed to be accounted for, officials said Saturday\n\n[Related live-story: 2 dead after Mexican Navy training ship carrying more than 200 people strikes underside of Brooklyn Bridge](https://archive.is/o/fVtpJ/https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/brooklyn-bridge-mexican-navy-ship-05-18-25-hnk)\n\nDramatic video shows the Cuauht\u00e9moc\u2019s masts hitting the underside of the bridge and breaking as the vessel passes underneath, with pieces falling down toward the deck.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know:\n\n**What happened**\n\nThe incident occurred around 8:20 p.m. local time as the ship was departing from New York\u2019s Pier 17, where it had been docked at the South Street Seaport Museum for five days of public viewing.\n\nThe ship\u2019s masts \u2013 bedecked in lights - struck the bridge, breaking on impact and sending debris falling onto the vessel\u2019s deck.\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams said the ship lost power. City officials earlier said \u201cmechanical issues\u201d may have caused the incident, but cautioned all information so far is preliminary. An investigation is ongoing.\n\nThe New York Fire Department said in an email to CNN it received the call that a ship had struck the bridge around 8:39 p.m. More than 100 fire and emergency medical service personnel responded to the scene, NYFD said in its email.\n\nVideo of the Mexican Navy training ship shortly after it struck the Brooklyn Bridge showed people hanging from at least one of its masts. On tall ships like the Cuauht\u00e9moc, it is a ceremonial tradition for sailors to climb the masts and rigging when departing or arriving into harbor.\n\n\u201cWe could see some people being kind of dragged,\u201d an eyewitness, Flavio Moreira, told CNN. \u201cI believe it was some of the staff, they were on the top of the boat. And they were swinging around, back and forth as soon as the ship hit the bridge.\u201d\n\n**Multiple killed**\n\nTwo people were killed and two remain in critical condition, Adams said. The two who died fell from one of the ship\u2019s masts, the law enforcement official told CNN. They were pronounced dead after being taken to a nearby hospital, the official said.\n\n\u201cAt this time, of the 277 on board, 19 sustained injuries, 2 of which remain in critical condition, and 2 more have sadly passed away from their injuries,\u201d Adams\u00a0[wrote on X](https://archive.is/o/fVtpJ/https://x.com/NYCMayor/status/1923956324737351832).\n\nThe Mexican Navy said earlier a total of 22 people were injured, 19 of whom were taken to hospitals.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said the two people killed were crew members and sent her condolences to their families.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply saddened by the loss of two crew members of the Cuauht\u00e9moc Training Ship, who lost their lives in the unfortunate accident in New York Harbor. Our sympathy and support go out to their families,\u201d Sheinbaum said in a post on X early Sunday.\n\nSheinbaum said the Mexican Navy is supporting those injured in the incident, and that the Mexican ambassador to the United States and Mexican Consulate General were supporting the navy.\n\n**An investigation underway**\n\nThe ship appeared to lose power around 8:20 p.m. as the captain was maneuvering the ship, which forced the vessel toward the bridge\u2019s pillar and the ship\u2019s mast struck the bridge, New York Police Department Chief Wilson Aramboles said at a news conference Saturday.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board is conducting an investigation.\n\nMexican authorities described the Cuauht\u00e9moc ship as a steel-hulled three-masted barque with a length of around 300 feet and a height of roughly 160 feet, a 2024\u00a0[news release](https://archive.is/o/fVtpJ/https://sailleeuwin.com/news-stories/cuauhtemoc-press-release-australia-nz-2024/)\u00a0from one of its training cruises said.\n\nGovernment\u00a0[documents](https://archive.is/o/fVtpJ/https://nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/publications/coast-pilot/files/cp2/CPB2_C09_WEB.pdf)\u00a0show the Brooklyn Bridge has a navigational clearance of 127 feet, roughly 30 feet shorter than the height of the sailing ship.\n\nThere was no visible damage to the Brooklyn Bridge, which appeared to be left structurally intact.\n\n\u201cWhile inspections will remain ongoing, there are no signs of structural damage to the Brooklyn Bridge,\u201d NY Department of Transportation said in a\u00a0[post](https://archive.is/o/fVtpJ/https://x.com/NYC_DOT/status/1923934086554349869)\u00a0on X.\n\nTraffic was temporarily closed in both directions for about 40 minutes as emergency services responded to the scene. It was later reopened following a preliminary inspection, Adams said.\n\nThis ship has been moved to Manhattan\u2019s Pier 36, located along the East River less than a mile from the Brooklyn Bridge, according to the law enforcement official.\n\n**What do we know about the ship?**\n\nThe Cuauht\u00e9moc is a training sailing ship of the Mexican Navy and described by officials as a diplomatic symbol of Mexico abroad.\n\nKnown as the \u201cAmbassador and Knight of the Seas,\u201d the ship was in New York as part of a global goodwill tour and was en route to Iceland at the time of the incident.\n\nA spokesperson for the New York City-area\u00a0[Sail4th 250](https://archive.is/o/fVtpJ/https://www.sail4th.org/)\u00a0events told CNN that the Cuauht\u00e9moc ship had \u201cwelcomed dignitaries and media\u201d as part of its New York stop on its global tour.\n\nThe sailing ship was expected to join the parade of international tall ships to celebrate the United States\u2019s 250 anniversary on July 4, 2026 \u2013 in what the event is calling \u201cthe largest-ever flotilla of tall ships from around the world.\n\n\u201dBuilt in Spain in 1981, the ship was acquired by the Mexican Navy to train cadets and officers. It regularly takes part in major regattas around the world. According to a\u00a0[news release\u00a0](https://archive.is/o/fVtpJ/https://sailleeuwin.com/news-stories/cuauhtemoc-press-release-australia-nz-2024/)from one of its global cruises, it was used for training by the Heroic Naval Military School, an elite military academy in Mexico.\n\nThe ship, as of last year, had visited 212 ports in 64 countries with 756,085 nautical miles sailed, the latter equivalent to making 35 trips around the world, the release said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.",

                "The NWS station in Jackson that is responsible for some of these areas is so understaffed that they close at night. The tornado that hit London, KY was very obviously dangerous and known to be on the ground for almost an hour before it hit the town. But proper alerts were not sent out to all the people that were sleeping because there was no one to send them. This is what everyone against the cuts was warning about.\n\nI want to edit to add that the Jackson, KY NWS personnel did the best they could. There were some staff present, but according to them, it was 4-5 people short of being ideal, again because of the funding cuts. I imagine burnout on nights like this is unavoidable. It was a chaotic night weather wise, and the few thousand dollars saved by short staffing these sites cost what is now up to over 20 lives.",
                "Hank Green did a video yesterday that was passive aggressively about this. He said we don\u2019t know when we don\u2019t die, and how so much advancement and regulations have saved millions of lives without ever making a headline.",
                "The NOAA radio nearest to me got taken down and I sat through one of these tornadoes with NO WEATHER UPDATES  because of it. Thanks defunding. It definitely wouldn't have been helpful to know where the tornado was and which direction it was moving and how fast. Clearly government waste.",
                "If only there was a type of agency that tracks national oceanic and atmospheric anomalies to help that is government funded and warns people of these things... oh wait.",
                "Sirens didn't go off here until it was too late. People are dead directly because of the funding cuts to NWS and NOAA. It's only going to get worse.",
                "Good thing we got rid of that pesky **FEMA**.\n\n\n*.end simulation*      \n**.now**",
                "Didn't DOGE cut the weather forecast services and one of the warnings of doing it would lead to people dying from the lack of hazardous weather warnings?",
                "Is now the time for an \"I did that\" sticker?",
                "It's sad, but at least we have a robust system for helping in these situations. Oh, wait, rich assholes needed another tax cut. Oh well, we tried. Pray harder, I guess, because I don't pray, and this comment is the extent of my thoughts on the subject.\u00a0",
                "Always thought captain planet was the wildest show and totally unrealistic because I never understood the villain's motivations. I still don't understand, but seeing these villains become real has been a sobering experience"
