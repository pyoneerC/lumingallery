They knew the judge was ruling on this situation. They knew they could have had the plane wait until the ruling came down to have it deport these people IF it was legal. They knew what they were doing was illegal anyways. **They still did it**.\n\nLet me also be clear, this is not about gang members. If these people truly were members of a Venezuelan gang, then go through due process AND THEN deport them. Same result. This is about pushing our due process to it's limits to see what you can get away with, then justifying it with \"Oh well it was gang members, you don't want gang members here DO YOU?\", and the entire point is \"How do WE know they were gang members if you rounded them up and deported them without any due process?\".\n\nTHAT'S THE ENTIRE POINT. This is how they're allowed to make people disappear, because they are violating your rights and using the cover of \"it's gang members!\" to do it, just like previous administrations did with \"Oh they're terrorists!\"."

If these people truly were members of a Venezuelan gang, then go through due process AND THEN deport them. Same result.
