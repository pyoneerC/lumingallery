                "The US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, said on Wednesday that he had directed the FDA to review the regulations around the abortion pill mifepristone.\n\nThe review, he said, was necessary due to \u201cnew data\u201d \u2013 data that emerged from a flawed analysis that top US anti-abortion groups are now using to pressure the Trump administration to reimpose restrictions on the abortion pill, if not pull it from the market entirely.\n\n...**The analysis, which has not been peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal**, came after the Food and Drug Administration commissioner said he was open to reviewing new safety data on the pills, which are used in nearly two-thirds of abortions nationwide.\n\nThe conservative organizations are rallying behind a paper published on 28 April by a rightwing thinktank, the Ethics and Public Policy Center, which claims there are higher complication rates from taking mifepristone than previously known.\n\nThe paper has attracted scrutiny for appearing to dramatically overstate what it characterizes as \u201cserious adverse effects\u201d associated with the pill, according to medical experts. For example, it counts ectopic pregnancies \u2013 when an embryo implants somewhere other than the uterine lining \u2013 as a serious complication.\n\nMifepristone does not cause an ectopic pregnancy and taking it will not harm someone with an ectopic. It also claims that needing an in-clinic procedure to complete the abortion is a complication, when patients are counseled in advance about the pills\u2019 failure rate of about 3 to 4%.\n\n**The data, the authors say, means the FDA should reinstate earlier restrictions on mifepristone, including a ban on telemedicine and limiting use to the first seven weeks of pregnancy \u2013 but they do not intend to stop there.**\n\nThe authors note that restoring the limits could lead to better monitoring that could help \u201cdetermine whether this drug should remain on the market\u201d, statements that echo proposals found in Project 2025, the 900-page playbook published by the Heritage Foundation and for which the EPPC was an advisory board member.\n\n**Project 2025 calls to end telemedicine prescriptions of abortion pills as an \u201cinterim step\u201d to revoking mifepristone\u2019s approval altogether.**\n\nMore than 100 scientific studies have found the medications cited in the paper are safe and effective for ending a pregnancy.",
                "For my miscarriage- I took mifepristone so that I would be in pain for a weekend instead of an indefinite time over the course of 4 weeks.  There was no fetal development.  But if my body couldn\u2019t pass the tissue on its own, then I could have been in excruciating pain for a month or more and on the line to lose my job, or worse possibly developed sepsis.\n\n1 in 4 known pregnancies end in miscarriage.  It\u2019s even higher for first time pregnancy.  This is not an outlier situation.  You know people who have had miscarriages and gotten treatment for it.  All this medication ban would do is make women suffer. \n\nThese people are extreme lunatics.   Death cult material who think women are property and status symbols, not people.",

It's a state university who is seeing a demographic that they don't think will latent their college alongside a trend they think is going to rock PA and shrinking itself now so it doesn't embarrass itself later. I don't know the state of PA so I don't know how this affects those closing campuses but I do feel that it's better to close than to occupy at limited capacity just to state that you're still open.

                "Review has already been done. It does exactly what it says it does and is perfectly safe",
                "The US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, said on Wednesday that he had directed the FDA to review the regulations around the abortion pill mifepristone.\n\nThe review, he said, was necessary due to \u201cnew data\u201d \u2013 data that emerged from a flawed analysis that top US anti-abortion groups are now using to pressure the Trump administration to reimpose restrictions on the abortion pill, if not pull it from the market entirely.\n\n...**The analysis, which has not been peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal**, came after the Food and Drug Administration commissioner said he was open to reviewing new safety data on the pills, which are used in nearly two-thirds of abortions nationwide.\n\nThe conservative organizations are rallying behind a paper published on 28 April by a rightwing thinktank, the Ethics and Public Policy Center, which claims there are higher complication rates from taking mifepristone than previously known.\n\nThe paper has attracted scrutiny for appearing to dramatically overstate what it characterizes as \u201cserious adverse effects\u201d associated with the pill, according to medical experts. For example, it counts ectopic pregnancies \u2013 when an embryo implants somewhere other than the uterine lining \u2013 as a serious complication.\n\nMifepristone does not cause an ectopic pregnancy and taking it will not harm someone with an ectopic. It also claims that needing an in-clinic procedure to complete the abortion is a complication, when patients are counseled in advance about the pills\u2019 failure rate of about 3 to 4%.\n\n**The data, the authors say, means the FDA should reinstate earlier restrictions on mifepristone, including a ban on telemedicine and limiting use to the first seven weeks of pregnancy \u2013 but they do not intend to stop there.**\n\nThe authors note that restoring the limits could lead to better monitoring that could help \u201cdetermine whether this drug should remain on the market\u201d, statements that echo proposals found in Project 2025, the 900-page playbook published by the Heritage Foundation and for which the EPPC was an advisory board member.\n\n**Project 2025 calls to end telemedicine prescriptions of abortion pills as an \u201cinterim step\u201d to revoking mifepristone\u2019s approval altogether.**\n\nMore than 100 scientific studies have found the medications cited in the paper are safe and effective for ending a pregnancy.",
                "For my miscarriage- I took mifepristone so that I would be in pain for a weekend instead of an indefinite time over the course of 4 weeks.  There was no fetal development.  But if my body couldn\u2019t pass the tissue on its own, then I could have been in excruciating pain for a month or more and on the line to lose my job, or worse possibly developed sepsis.\n\n1 in 4 known pregnancies end in miscarriage.  It\u2019s even higher for first time pregnancy.  This is not an outlier situation.  You know people who have had miscarriages and gotten treatment for it.  All this medication ban would do is make women suffer. \n\nThese people are extreme lunatics.   Death cult material who think women are property and status symbols, not people.",
