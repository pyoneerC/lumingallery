They can tell you if care is futile and won\u2019t benefit the patient. Having said that, renal failure is not a death sentence. It\u2019s a very difficult life with dialysis catheters and potentially a fistula. There could be intentional deception of lack of understand and fear combined to make that leap. However, her claims against Prince Amdrew have been corroborated with evidence and I 100% believe her.",

I miss them so very much. I have been through hell & back in my 41 years but this is incredibly hurting me worse than anything else.\nHurt me, abuse me but don't take my babies.

She will probably make a full recovery.",
