                "From The Guardian:\n\n>A 19-year-old Venezuelan in New York City reportedly was apprehended by Trump administration immigration authorities and deported to El Salvador despite agents\u2019 realizing he was not whom they meant to arrest in a targeted operation.\n\n>Merwil Guti\u00e9rrez, whose family opened an asylum case after arriving in the US, was deported from the Bronx to the notorious Cecot prison in El Salvador despite his relatives\u2019 insistence that he has no gang ties or criminal history, according to Documented, a newsroom dedicated to telling the stories of immigrants in New York City. The Guti\u00e9rrez family says it has been left without information or answers.\n\n>The teen was detained alongside 237 other Venezuelans on 24 February by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). His father, Wilmer Guti\u00e9rrez, told Documented: \u201cI feel like my son was kidnapped.\n\n>\u201cI\u2019ve spent countless hours searching for him, going from one precinct to another, speaking with numerous people who kept referring me elsewhere. Yet, after all this, no one has given me any information or provided a single document about his case.\u201d\n\n>The elder Guti\u00e9rrez reportedly said he overheard Ice agents saying that his son had not been the person they had come to get.\n\n>**The officers grabbed him and two other boys right at the entrance to our building. One said: \u2018No, he\u2019s not the one,\u2019 like they were looking for someone else. But the other said: \u2018Take him anyway,\u2019\u201d he recalled.**\n\n>**Guti\u00e9rrez has no criminal record either in Venezuela or the US, his family said. He also did not have any tattoos** which is a feature that US law enforcement often use to link people to the Tren de Aragua gang \u2013 a transnational criminal organization from Venezuela \u2013 and to justify their expulsions from the country.\n\n>**Despite this, Guti\u00e9rrez was arrested and later deported to El Salvador, to which he has no ties.**\n\n>Wilmer Guti\u00e9rrez says he discovered through a news report that his son had been deported to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. He watched videos on social media that showed detainees facing harsh conditions, such as having their heads shaved by authorities and being marched to their prison cells.\n\n>\u201dI could have understood if he\u2019d been sent back to Venezuela,\u201d he said. \u201cBut why to a foreign country he\u2019s never even been to?\u201d\n\n>The Guti\u00e9rrez family\u2019s reported ordeal comes after the Trump administration admitted to wrongly deporting a Maryland man, Kilmar Abrego Garc\u00eda, to the same Cecot facility.\n\n>The president of El Salvador said in a meeting with Trump on Monday that the Salvadoran government would not order the return of Abrego Garc\u00eda to the US.\n\n>Monday\u2019s meeting at the White House came amid a broader push by the Trump administration to remove noncitizens from the US, including people who are here legally and have not been charged with crimes.\n\n>Trump has also openly stated that he would like to remove US citizens who commit unspecified violent crimes and send them to the same Salvadoran prison as Abrego Garc\u00eda and Guti\u00e9rrez.",

With Trump, theres no trial, and its just the whim of one man.\n\nWhat Trump is doing flies directly in the face of the Revolution and Constitution.

The dark irony in all of this is that the most alarmist resist libs were literally right about everything.\n\nFuck the animals who are participating in these orders.

DOGE staffers stole 10 gigabytes worth of data from NLRB's network, and then attempted to hide their trail so no one would find out. They're stealing information on almost all americans, but also sensitive information on unions, ongoing legal cases and corporate secrets, including cases involving Musk's companies.

He said that beginning in early March, logging protocols created to audit users appeared to have been tampered with, and that he had detected the removal of about 10 gigabytes worth of data from NLRB's network sometime thereafter.\n\n> That kind of spike is extremely unusual because data almost never directly leaves NLRB's databases,\" Berulis said in his affidavit.\nA spokesperson for Musk's team - officially known as U.S. DOGE Service - didn't immediately return a message seeking comment. A message left with the NLRB also wasn't immediately returned, although NPR, which first reported the story, opens new tab, quoted an NLRB spokesperson as disputing Berulis' claims and saying there had been no breach. Cotton and Warner didn't immediately return messages seeking comment.\n\n> NPR, which said it interviewed 30 sources in government, law enforcement, the cybersecurity industry, and the labor movement about the complaint, said that the disabling of logging software was reminiscent of cybercriminal behavior.\n\n>Berulis' affidavit said that an effort by him and his colleague to formally investigate and alert the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) was disrupted by higher-ups without explanation. A message left with CISA wasn't immediately returned.",

I missed it.",

                "Just want to point out how Mr. Garcia's case illustrates how if the US permits the deportation of criminals, Trump will have unlimited power to imprison Americans without trial and without judicial review.\n\nThe mechanism for releasing a person imprisoned unlawfully is a legal process called Habeas Corpus, or a Habeas petition.  A Habeast petition, legally, is an instruction issued by the Court to an officer of the government to indicate that the detention of an individual is unlawful, and to order that person's release.\n\nIf a person is unlawfully detained in an American prison, the way you get out is to have a Habeas petition accepted by a US Court, which then issues the Court order granting release.\n\nWhy doesn't this work for Mr. Garcia?  Because Mr. Garcia is being held in an El Savadorian Prison--the Court can determine that his deportation and imprisonment is unlawful, but the Court lacks the legal authority to tell El Salvadore to do anything.\n\nWhat's less clear is what the Court can do to compel the Executive Branch to act to bring him back--that is a KEY question in this case.\n\nBut this also highlights how if the President were permitted to imprison people overseas, all Due Process rights for Americans would disappear in an instant.\n\nSalvadorian prisons do not need to comply with Habeas Petitions.  If an American were arrested in the middle of the night and put on a plane to a prison in El Salvadore, the only way to ordinarily release that person would be to file a Habeas Petition--but that person is already overseas and under the management of the Gov't of El Salvadore.\n\nThe Executive Branch could refuse to seek that person's release from El Salvadore and the their govnerment could comply with that request.\n\nAnd the Courts would be powerless to enforce a finding that the imprisonment of an American is illegal.\n\nIn other words, Trump could have people arrested whenever he wanted to and imprison them without trial by shipping them to El Salvador, and the Courts would be powerless to stop him.\n\nTrump's push to imprison Americans in overseas prisons is one of the most Constitutionally dangerous proposals I have heard in my lifetime.",

                "From The Guardian:\n\n>A 19-year-old Venezuelan in New York City reportedly was apprehended by Trump administration immigration authorities and deported to El Salvador despite agents\u2019 realizing he was not whom they meant to arrest in a targeted operation.\n\n>Merwil Guti\u00e9rrez, whose family opened an asylum case after arriving in the US, was deported from the Bronx to the notorious Cecot prison in El Salvador despite his relatives\u2019 insistence that he has no gang ties or criminal history, according to Documented, a newsroom dedicated to telling the stories of immigrants in New York City. The Guti\u00e9rrez family says it has been left without information or answers.\n\n>The teen was detained alongside 237 other Venezuelans on 24 February by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). His father, Wilmer Guti\u00e9rrez, told Documented: \u201cI feel like my son was kidnapped.\n\n>\u201cI\u2019ve spent countless hours searching for him, going from one precinct to another, speaking with numerous people who kept referring me elsewhere. Yet, after all this, no one has given me any information or provided a single document about his case.\u201d\n\n>The elder Guti\u00e9rrez reportedly said he overheard Ice agents saying that his son had not been the person they had come to get.\n\n>**The officers grabbed him and two other boys right at the entrance to our building. One said: \u2018No, he\u2019s not the one,\u2019 like they were looking for someone else. But the other said: \u2018Take him anyway,\u2019\u201d he recalled.**\n\n>**Guti\u00e9rrez has no criminal record either in Venezuela or the US, his family said. He also did not have any tattoos** which is a feature that US law enforcement often use to link people to the Tren de Aragua gang \u2013 a transnational criminal organization from Venezuela \u2013 and to justify their expulsions from the country.\n\n>**Despite this, Guti\u00e9rrez was arrested and later deported to El Salvador, to which he has no ties.**\n\n>Wilmer Guti\u00e9rrez says he discovered through a news report that his son had been deported to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. He watched videos on social media that showed detainees facing harsh conditions, such as having their heads shaved by authorities and being marched to their prison cells.\n\n>\u201dI could have understood if he\u2019d been sent back to Venezuela,\u201d he said. \u201cBut why to a foreign country he\u2019s never even been to?\u201d\n\n>The Guti\u00e9rrez family\u2019s reported ordeal comes after the Trump administration admitted to wrongly deporting a Maryland man, Kilmar Abrego Garc\u00eda, to the same Cecot facility.\n\n>The president of El Salvador said in a meeting with Trump on Monday that the Salvadoran government would not order the return of Abrego Garc\u00eda to the US.\n\n>Monday\u2019s meeting at the White House came amid a broader push by the Trump administration to remove noncitizens from the US, including people who are here legally and have not been charged with crimes.\n\n>Trump has also openly stated that he would like to remove US citizens who commit unspecified violent crimes and send them to the same Salvadoran prison as Abrego Garc\u00eda and Guti\u00e9rrez.",

With Trump, theres no trial, and its just the whim of one man.\n\nWhat Trump is doing flies directly in the face of the Revolution and Constitution. He openly plots to extend this treatment to citizens. He is a tyrant and all means of resistance to him and his lackeys is justified.",

The dark irony in all of this is that the most alarmist resist libs were literally right about everything.\n\nFuck the animals who are participating in these orders.

DOGE staffers stole 10 gigabytes worth of data from NLRB's network, and then attempted to hide their trail so no one would find out. They're stealing information on almost all americans, but also sensitive information on unions, ongoing legal cases and corporate secrets, including cases involving Musk's companies.

He said that beginning in early March, logging protocols created to audit users appeared to have been tampered with, and that he had detected the removal of about 10 gigabytes worth of data from NLRB's network sometime thereafter.\n\n> That kind of spike is extremely unusual because data almost never directly leaves NLRB's databases,\" Berulis said in his affidavit.\nA spokesperson for Musk's team - officially known as U.S. DOGE Service - didn't immediately return a message seeking comment. A message left with the NLRB also wasn't immediately returned, although NPR, which first reported the story, opens new tab, quoted an NLRB spokesperson as disputing Berulis' claims and saying there had been no breach. Cotton and Warner didn't immediately return messages seeking comment.\n\n> NPR, which said it interviewed 30 sources in government, law enforcement, the cybersecurity industry, and the labor movement about the complaint, said that the disabling of logging software was reminiscent of cybercriminal behavior.\n\n>Berulis' affidavit said that an effort by him and his colleague to formally investigate and alert the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) was disrupted by higher-ups without explanation. A message left with CISA wasn't immediately returned.",
