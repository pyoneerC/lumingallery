                "This is a real tragedy. These trucks take bees from thousands of keepers down to California for events like almond plant pollination. If they can\u2019t clean it up in a way that gives the bees time to find their own queens among the wreckage, almost all of them are doomed. And it\u2019ll be a total loss for the farmers, pending insurance. California farmers need to find more bees or not get pollinated, Washington farmers need to replace the bees they\u2019ve raised. Local region gets a bunch of stressed out honeybees with nowhere to go. It\u2019ll take some really careful mitigation to recover it all, on top of handling the accident and the surrounding humanity.\u00a0\n\nAlso, ridiculous that our farming infrastructure requires bee imports for pollination. How about boost the habitat around the farms and cut down on the monoculture crops? All the highways and stormwater ditches should be no-mow in the dry summer. Retain moisture in the vegetation and give a wildlife coordinator to connect habitat fragments and boost pollination. And save on public works maintenance costs. The problem for these bees is that there are no flowers most of the summer, and then a mega monoculture blooms and expects there to be billions of bees and butterflies to support it. But also here\u2019s neurological pesticides like neonics to kill the \u201cbad bugs.\u201d You reap what you sow.\u00a0",
                "there are roughly 30,000 bees in a hive at this time of year.\n\n33 hives to reach a million.\n\n250x33 is 8250 hive boxes.\n\na Langstroth hive is roughly 20x16x12 inches.  So you'd get 6 on a standard pallet layer, maybe 3 layers preparatory for doublestacking.. that's 458 pallets.\n\nI think the deputy making the announcement was off by a factor of 4 to 5.  Still a terrifying event, though.",
                "I\u2019m surprised that 250 million bees is only one truckload",
                "True story.   \nI had 2 hives in my back yard for a few years and we had to move. So we waited until it was dark (so all the bees are in the hives, we closed it up and put them in the back of my enclosed SUV. We were driving them about an hour and a half away to their new home. So in the middle of the drive, around midnight we noticed a bee flying around in the front of the car. Then another... so we stopped at a gas station, popped the back open and the bees were bearding on the outside of one of the hives. LOTS of them. So, luckily we had our trusty suits with us and we put them on at the gas station, just as a fire truck pulls up. \n\n\"You alright?\" The fireman asks us. \n\n\"Yea, the bees just got out.\" I respond back. \n\n\"Oh.\" he pauses for a good 3 seconds..\"Good luck with that.\" he says, then he puts the fire truck in gear and drives out.\n\nI guess we looked silly (or sus) putting on beekeeping suits at a gas station, at midnight, in an urban area. Anyway, we then got back in the car, cranked the AC to max to keep the bees cool so that they don't get angy. In the end we succeeded in rehoming the hives without too much of an issue. (we were able to move the hive with the bees all over the outside.)",
                "As a beekeeper myself I highly doubt the number of 250 million is accurate. Someone probably added a zero too many\n\nIn the peek of the season a hive contains 50.000 to 60.000 bees.\n\nWith the US Langstroth hives of 54 x 46? cm this would mean roughly 5000 hives are necessary, which would not fit on a trailer.\n\nI would rather expect that on a truck with a maximum trailer length of 16-18m there would be ca. 500+ hives, averaging on ca. 25 million bees.\n\nIt's a horrible incident, but the reporter needs to get his facts straight, someone definitely messed this up big time.",

If they can\u2019t clean it up in a way that gives the bees time to find their own queens among the wreckage, almost all of them are doomed. And it\u2019ll be a total loss for the farmers, pending insurance. California farmers need to find more bees or not get pollinated, Washington farmers need to replace the bees they\u2019ve raised. Local region gets a bunch of stressed out honeybees with nowhere to go. It\u2019ll take some really careful mitigation to recover it all, on top of handling the accident and the surrounding humanity.\u00a0\n\nAlso, ridiculous that our farming infrastructure requires bee imports for pollination. How about boost the habitat around the farms and cut down on the monoculture crops? All the highways and stormwater ditches should be no-mow in the dry summer. Retain moisture in the vegetation and give a wildlife coordinator to connect habitat fragments and boost pollination. And save on public works maintenance costs. The problem for these bees is that there are no flowers most of the summer, and then a mega monoculture blooms and expects there to be billions of bees and butterflies to support it. But also here\u2019s neurological pesticides like neonics to kill the \u201cbad bugs.\u201d You reap what you sow.\u00a0",

                "True story.   \nI had 2 hives in my back yard for a few years and we had to move. So we waited until it was dark (so all the bees are in the hives, we closed it up and put them in the back of my enclosed SUV. We were driving them about an hour and a half away to their new home. So in the middle of the drive, around midnight we noticed a bee flying around in the front of the car. Then another... so we stopped at a gas station, popped the back open and the bees were bearding on the outside of one of the hives. LOTS of them. So, luckily we had our trusty suits with us and we put them on at the gas station, just as a fire truck pulls up. \n\n\"You alright?\" The fireman asks us. \n\n\"Yea, the bees just got out.\" I respond back. \n\n\"Oh.\" he pauses for a good 3 seconds..\"Good luck with that.\" he says, then he puts the fire truck in gear and drives out.\n\nI guess we looked silly (or sus) putting on beekeeping suits at a gas station, at midnight, in an urban area. Anyway, we then got back in the car, cranked the AC to max to keep the bees cool so that they don't get angy. In the end we succeeded in rehoming the hives without too much of an issue. (we were able to move the hive with the bees all over the outside.)",
                "As a beekeeper myself I highly doubt the number of 250 million is accurate. Someone probably added a zero too many\n\nIn the peek of the season a hive contains 50.000 to 60.000 bees.\n\nWith the US Langstroth hives of 54 x 46? cm this would mean roughly 5000 hives are necessary, which would not fit on a trailer.\n\nI would rather expect that on a truck with a maximum trailer length of 16-18m there would be ca. 500+ hives, averaging on ca. 25 million bees.\n\nIt's a horrible incident, but the reporter needs to get his facts straight, someone definitely messed this up big time.",

And it\u2019ll be a total loss for the farmers, pending insurance. California farmers need to find more bees or not get pollinated, Washington farmers need to replace the bees they\u2019ve raised. Local region gets a bunch of stressed out honeybees with nowhere to go. It\u2019ll take some really careful mitigation to recover it all, on top of handling the accident and the surrounding humanity.\u00a0\n\nAlso, ridiculous that our farming infrastructure requires bee imports for pollination. How about boost the habitat around the farms and cut down on the monoculture crops? All the highways and stormwater ditches should be no-mow in the dry summer. Retain moisture in the vegetation and give a wildlife coordinator to connect habitat fragments and boost pollination. And save on public works maintenance costs. The problem for these bees is that there are no flowers most of the summer, and then a mega monoculture blooms and expects there to be billions of bees and butterflies to support it. But also here\u2019s neurological pesticides like neonics to kill the \u201cbad bugs.\u201d You reap what you sow.\u00a0",
                "there are roughly 30,000 bees in a hive at this time of year.\n\n33 hives to reach a million.\n\n250x33 is 8250 hive boxes.\n\na Langstroth hive is roughly 20x16x12 inches.  So you'd get 6 on a standard pallet layer, maybe 3 layers preparatory for doublestacking.. that's 458 pallets.\n\nI think the deputy making the announcement was off by a factor of 4 to 5.  Still a terrifying event, though.",
                "I\u2019m surprised that 250 million bees is only one truckload",
                "True story.   \nI had 2 hives in my back yard for a few years and we had to move. So we waited until it was dark (so all the bees are in the hives, we closed it up and put them in the back of my enclosed SUV. We were driving them about an hour and a half away to their new home. So in the middle of the drive, around midnight we noticed a bee flying around in the front of the car. Then another... so we stopped at a gas station, popped the back open and the bees were bearding on the outside of one of the hives. LOTS of them. So, luckily we had our trusty suits with us and we put them on at the gas station, just as a fire truck pulls up. \n\n\"You alright?\" The fireman asks us. \n\n\"Yea, the bees just got out.\" I respond back. \n\n\"Oh.\" he pauses for a good 3 seconds..\"Good luck with that.\" he says, then he puts the fire truck in gear and drives out.\n\nI guess we looked silly (or sus) putting on beekeeping suits at a gas station, at midnight, in an urban area. Anyway, we then got back in the car, cranked the AC to max to keep the bees cool so that they don't get angy. In the end we succeeded in rehoming the hives without too much of an issue. (we were able to move the hive with the bees all over the outside.)",
                "As a beekeeper myself I highly doubt the number of 250 million is accurate. Someone probably added a zero too many\n\nIn the peek of the season a hive contains 50.000 to 60.000 bees.\n\nWith the US Langstroth hives of 54 x 46? cm this would mean roughly 5000 hives are necessary, which would not fit on a trailer.\n\nI would rather expect that on a truck with a maximum trailer length of 16-18m there would be ca. 500+ hives, averaging on ca. 25 million bees.\n\nIt's a horrible incident, but the reporter needs to get his facts straight, someone definitely messed this up big time.",
                "Flat country, looks like a straight, quiet two-lane road, no intersection, no other cars, how did his load end up sideways in the ditch?\n\nEdit: NYT photo suggests it was turning right and couldn't roll the front out far enough to miss the ditch with the rear wheels. That's why the tractor was in the left lane.",
