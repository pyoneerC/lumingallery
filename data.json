                "Landlords used to do this same thing pre-AI by calling around to all local competitors weekly and getting their prices (with the caveat that the other communities probably wouldn\u2019t answer the phone, would say they didn\u2019t share that information, or would give incorrect information). This AI generated software was created in part to reduce the manpower needed to call and/or send out their employees to mystery shop other communities. By banning it, I can see where companies will need additional staffing to keep up with pricing trends (obviously going backwards from the AI technology that every other industry is going to), and will likely have to raise rates more to compensate for those extra salaries. So I guess it\u2019s 6 of one, a half dozen of the other. (Most apartment communities are generally understaffed anyway, so having the existing employees add more work to their already full plates would create losses in other areas, such as actually being in the office to tour prospective renters to get them to rent, instead of being out shopping other communities.) They could employ mystery shop companies, but those can cost over $100 per shop, which again would lead to increased rates for renters to cover the additional fees. I\u2019m not sure if I see much of a long term win here, but I guess we\u2019ll find out."

This AI generated software was created in part to reduce the manpower needed to call and/or send out their employees to mystery shop other communities. By banning it, I can see where companies will need additional staffing to keep up with pricing trends (obviously going backwards from the AI technology that every other industry is going to), and will likely have to raise rates more to compensate for those extra salaries. So I guess it\u2019s 6 of one, a half dozen of the other. (Most apartment communities are generally understaffed anyway, so having the existing employees add more work to their already full plates would create losses in other areas, such as actually being in the office to tour prospective renters to get them to rent, instead of being out shopping other communities.) They could employ mystery shop companies, but those can cost over $100 per shop, which again would lead to increased rates for renters to cover the additional fees. I\u2019m not sure if I see much of a long term win here, but I guess we\u2019ll find out."

This AI generated software was created in part to reduce the manpower needed to call and/or send out their employees to mystery shop other communities. By banning it, I can see where companies will need additional staffing to keep up with pricing trends (obviously going backwards from the AI technology that every other industry is going to), and will likely have to raise rates more to compensate for those extra salaries. So I guess it\u2019s 6 of one, a half dozen of the other. (Most apartment communities are generally understaffed anyway, so having the existing employees add more work to their already full plates would create losses in other areas, such as actually being in the office to tour prospective renters to get them to rent, instead of being out shopping other communities.) They could employ mystery shop companies, but those can cost over $100 per shop, which again would lead to increased rates for renters to cover the additional fees. I\u2019m not sure if I see much of a long term win here, but I guess we\u2019ll find out."
