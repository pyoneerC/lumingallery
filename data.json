                "My girlfriend with PCOS and very large cysts was told to \"come back later if it doesn't resolve itself after a while\", because \"it just goes away naturally most of the time\". After (IIRC) about half a year passed of constant, non-stop pain that was bad enough to prevent her from moving up and down the stairs of her own home, and an ovary quite visibly pushing against her abdomen with how swollen from cysts it was, she finally got someone to give enough of a shit to *consider* getting her scheduled for surgery; this wouldn't happen until at the nine month mark, when the ovary experienced a torsion and the pain somehow managed to skyrocket even more - although she was reassured it should sort itself out on its own.\n\nJust a couple weeks or so before the scheduled surgery, the pain started subsiding; while relieved it started to seemingly lighten up, my girlfriend still kept the surgery date so she could get it taken care of. Luckily she did, because it turns out the torsion ***DIDN'T*** sort itself out, the ovary strangled itself of blood supply, and was no longer hurting because it was fucking dead tissue. As it was, due to how filled with decaying tissue it was, had it ruptured at all during the flight home to get her surgery (she was visiting family on the other side of the country when it got scheduled), she would gone into sepsis and died in a matter of hours.\n\nAs it is, the incompetence of self-absorbed, chauvinistic cockwombles led to her losing half of her chances of having children outright. All because she was assured \"it would take care of itself\" as, *WHILE JUST A TEENAGER*, she was actively in tears just from existing.",
                "I knew a girl who died at 24 from stage 4 breast cancer after she went to get a lump checked and they told her it was just a cyst and denied her any further investigation. By the time they finally realised it was too late. I had a lump and had to BEG AND DEMAND a mammogram because I was \u201ctoo young\u201d. Thankfully nothing but after my friend died I will always advocate for myself.",

I had to go see him after\u00a0treatment and he said he was just so sorry and so surprised.\n\nI looked him dead in the face and said \"you fucked up. You assumed it was something else due to my age, gave up, and it cost me 6 critical months. I'm only here seeing you because my insurance required it.\"\n\nHe was a little shocked by that response too."

Luckily she did, because it turns out the torsion ***DIDN'T*** sort itself out, the ovary strangled itself of blood supply, and was no longer hurting because it was fucking dead tissue. As it was, due to how filled with decaying tissue it was, had it ruptured at all during the flight home to get her surgery (she was visiting family on the other side of the country when it got scheduled), she would gone into sepsis and died in a matter of hours.\n\nAs it is, the incompetence of self-absorbed, chauvinistic cockwombles led to her losing half of her chances of having children outright.

Luckily she did, because it turns out the torsion ***DIDN'T*** sort itself out, the ovary strangled itself of blood supply, and was no longer hurting because it was fucking dead tissue. As it was, due to how filled with decaying tissue it was, had it ruptured at all during the flight home to get her surgery (she was visiting family on the other side of the country when it got scheduled), she would gone into sepsis and died in a matter of hours.\n\nAs it is, the incompetence of self-absorbed, chauvinistic cockwombles led to her losing half of her chances of having children outright.
