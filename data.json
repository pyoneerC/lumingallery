That the bill at hand is a little complicated for the average person to understand. Why should the average person care about what rights shareholders have in the Court of Chancery? \n\n 2. A third of the State's revenue come from all the corporations stationed here.\n\nHere's a local Delaware article about the bill: [https://www.delawarepublic.org/politics-government/2025-03-25/delaware-house-passes-corporate-law-overhaul-after-rejecting-five-proposed-changes](https://www.delawarepublic.org/politics-government/2025-03-25/delaware-house-passes-corporate-law-overhaul-after-rejecting-five-proposed-changes)\n\n  \nThis wasn't a MAGA thing, this has been a blue state for awhile, with mostly blue representatives. I don't know if the reps votes were bought for (believable), or that they believe the threat of companies leaving was too great for the state.

                "> The bill mostly impacts companies with a controlling shareholder, like Meta Platforms (META.O), which is controlled by Zuckerberg. The proposal provides steps that allow for a company and its controlling shareholder to arrange deals, such as selling corporate assets to the controller, **that cannot be challenged in court by the company's other investors.**\n\n...\n\n> The bill prevents shareholders from challenging deals that are approved by a board committee that has a majority of independent directors or by a vote by public shareholders. The bill also limits records available to shareholders who want to investigate a deal for conflicts.\n\n> Numerous amendments were rejected, including one that would have eliminated the law's retroactive effective date. The law will be effective back to February 17, which one lawmaker said would eliminate potential legal liability for unspecified claims that he said shareholders were investigating against the board of Meta Platforms.\n\nSo if a deal (I guess between a company and a controlling shareholder?) was approved by a majority of *independent* directors or by a vote of public shareholders, it can't be challenged in court. That's... gonna be honest, I'm not keen on that. I'm not a big fan of not being able to challenge deals in court. \n\nBut at first glance it doesn't sound like the end of the world, though that may just be me having trouble actually envisioning scenarios like that (help me, corporate lawyers). But at least as long as the deals aren't beholden to conflicts of interest...\n\n...oh. Right. It also limits records available to investigate conflicts.\n\nGotta say, toe-deep knowledge of corporate law though I may have, I don't think it looks good.

The man she was visiting has been charged with murder in connection with her killing, Riebe said.\n\n>Dowells, a hairdresser, was killed while visiting her husband, David Brinson, 54, who was convicted in the 1990s of murdering four men during a robbery, and sentenced to four consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole.\n\n>After Brinson called prison officials at 2:04 a.m. on Nov. 13 to tell them his wife had passed out, officers immediately began life-saving measures and called 911, a spokesperson for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said. \n\n>But Dowells was pronounced dead a short time later.\n\n>Dowells\u2019 killing remains under investigation by prison officials and the district attorney\u2019s office, the spokesperson said. \n\n>Riebe said charges are pending prison and autopsy reports.",

They trusted this man enough to let their 3 year old visit him. Like what kind of vetting process is the prison using? The prison needs to answer for this. These weren't random acts they gave violent offenders private access to vulnerable visitors. How many more women need to die before they fix this broken system?",
