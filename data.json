But, as explained above, the Court cannot order DOJ to continue the prosecution, and it is aware of no authority (outside of the criminal contempt context) that would empower it, as some have urged, to appoint an independent prosecutor,\u201d Judge Ho wrote. \u201cTherefore, any decision by this Court to deny the Government\u2019s Motion to Dismiss would be futile at best, because DOJ could\u2014and, by all indications, unequivocally would\u2014simply refuse to prosecute the case, inevitably resulting in a dismissal after seventy days for violating the Mayor\u2019s right to a speedy trial. That route would simply postpone finality in this case to a date uncomfortably close to the June 24 mayoral primary. The public interest would not be served by such an outcome.\u201d\n\nSo basically the judge is saying, \u201cYes, the reasons DOJ wanted this dismissed are bad, but I can\u2019t force the prosecution to do their jobs, and if I dismiss with prejudice now they can\u2019t hold these charges over the head of an elected official to manipulate them.\u201d.

It was, in every sense of the word, leverage. A quid pro quo.\n\nThe Judge dismissed the case with prejudice, meaning it cannot be resurrected no matter what happens and there is no longer this leverage hanging over Adam's head. Of course, former prosecutors in the case maintained that Adams was guilty, and given federal prosecutors win rate at trial, you would assume he would have been convicted here.

Usually these vendors hire people are paid minimum wage but who can't get hired by Target, McDonald's, or any other job that pays $0.50 more per hour than minimum wage.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd if that's not bad enough these minum wage employees are ridiculously understaffed so only the ones that get off abusing kids stick around on the job, sort of the same that happens with prison guards.",
                "Twenty workers at a Philadelphia-area charter school were charged in connection with allegations of abuse of young children and failure to report it, prosecutors announced Monday.\n\nThe Chester Township Police Department said in court documents that security video captured roughly 100 incidents at Chester Community Charter School\u2019s West Campus in November and December involving what the district attorney\u2019s office said are 26 victims.\n\nThe victims, in grades K-5, were members of the school\u2019s emotional support program, the office of Delaware County District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer said in a statement. Some of them were as young as 5 years old, the DA\u2019s office said.\n\nStollsteimer said at a news conference Monday that he watched security video of the alleged abuse.\n\n\u201cThere are nine individuals who have surveillance video that I\u2019ve watched putting their hands on children, some as young as 5,\u201d Stollsteimer said. \u201cOftentimes, you can see them using their knee to take a child to the ground.\u201d\n\nStollsteimer said formal charges were filed Monday morning. \n\nPolice filed initial charges in state court March 25 after family members of two students separately raised concerns to the school on Jan. 9 and Jan. 10, according to court documents. \n\nAn unnamed parent said their 7-year-old son was afraid to go to school because two staffers had used physical holds on children in a \u201cpositive support room\u201d on campus, part of a program at the school called Team Approach to Achieving Academic Success, according to a police affidavit filed in support of charges.\n\nRelatives of another 7-year-old boy stepped forward the next day with similar complaints, the affidavit said. \n\nInvestigators said they found consistent accounts that staffers used \u201cshoulder work\u201d \u2014 including pinching pressure points on the neck, placing children in holds with their arms crossed in front of them and pushing knees into students\u2019 backs \u2014 as a way of gaining physical compliance, the affidavit said.\n\nNine defendants alleged to have abused or had physical contact with children were charged with conspiracy, simple assault, unlawful restraint, false imprisonment, endangering the welfare of a child and failure to report endangering the welfare of a child, the DA\u2019s office said.\n\nEleven defendants were charged with failure to report the alleged endangerment. Three of those charged with failure to report are school employees and were placed on leave pending further investigation, the school said in a statement.\n\nBoth groups of defendants include people with multiple counts of each charge. Police indicated a \u201cdean of students\u201d and \u201cteachers\u201d were among the second group.\n\nOn its website, the school lists the dean of students as Dahkeem Williams. \n\n\u201cWe take great exception to the District Attorney\u2019s statement that \u2018all the adults charged are equally guilty in failing to protect these children,\u2019\u201d Williams\u2019 attorney, who also represents another defendant in the case, told NBC Philadelphia.\n\n\nNone of those charged were in custody, but some have made arrangements to surrender, Stollsteimer\u2019s office said in its statement.\n\nOnline court records did not list attorneys for most defendants. The public defender\u2019s office for Delaware County did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday night.\n\n\u201cI am proud that today we are holding the support staff, teachers, and even a dean of students accountable for abusing or failing to report the abuse, of vulnerable children,\u201d Chester Township Police Chief Kenneth Coalson said in the DA\u2019s statement.\n\nStollsteimer noted that state law mandates reporting child abuse for those who work in school settings.\n\nIndividual incidents of using physical contact for compliance must each be reported under state regulations, and none were, according to the affidavit. \n\n\u201cThis is just unacceptable behavior to happen anywhere, but particularly in a school setting for children who are supposed to be getting emotional support,\u201d Stollsteimer said.\n\nThe school parent-teacher association did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday night.\n\nThe contractor for whom the DA said most of the defendants work, Peak Performers Staffing LLC, did not respond to a request for comment. Chester Community Charter School said it severed ties with the company and its workers.\n\nThe school said in a statement that 17 of those charged work for Peak Performers, which it said took over a previous, \u201chighly reputable\u201d contractor\u2019s emotional support work after that contractor discontinued the services the school was using.\n\nThe school said it was assured the Peak Performers employees were properly trained in physical contact with students but later learned they had not completed the necessary training.\n\nThe school characterized itself as an unnamed victim in the case, saying it was \u201cduped\u201d by Peak Performers.\n\n\u201cCCCS plans to pursue all appropriate legal recourse against Peak Performers for the reckless and dangerous manner in which it operated,\u201d the school said. \u201cCCCS leaders are outraged at the actions and inactions of Peak Performers and stands in solidarity with the other victims.\u201d \n\nIn 2018, Chester Community Charter School said it was the largest brick-and-mortar charter school in Pennsylvania. The K-8, four-campus school says it serves more than 4,000 students. Chester Township is about 22 miles southwest of Center City Philadelphia.",

                "I worked with children like this for 20 years. We stopped doing physical holds many many years ago because it was abusive,  it hurts and even kills children AND does nothing to control behavior in the long run.\n\nIt's lazy teaching, behavior management because it takes more time to build relationships, manage behaviors without being physical.\n\nShame on the staff, shame on the ones who didn't stop it or report it.",

                "Twenty workers at a Philadelphia-area charter school were charged in connection with allegations of abuse of young children and failure to report it, prosecutors announced Monday.\n\nThe Chester Township Police Department said in court documents that security video captured roughly 100 incidents at Chester Community Charter School\u2019s West Campus in November and December involving what the district attorney\u2019s office said are 26 victims.\n\nThe victims, in grades K-5, were members of the school\u2019s emotional support program, the office of Delaware County District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer said in a statement. Some of them were as young as 5 years old, the DA\u2019s office said.\n\nStollsteimer said at a news conference Monday that he watched security video of the alleged abuse.\n\n\u201cThere are nine individuals who have surveillance video that I\u2019ve watched putting their hands on children, some as young as 5,\u201d Stollsteimer said. \u201cOftentimes, you can see them using their knee to take a child to the ground.\u201d\n\nStollsteimer said formal charges were filed Monday morning. \n\nPolice filed initial charges in state court March 25 after family members of two students separately raised concerns to the school on Jan. 9 and Jan. 10, according to court documents. \n\nAn unnamed parent said their 7-year-old son was afraid to go to school because two staffers had used physical holds on children in a \u201cpositive support room\u201d on campus, part of a program at the school called Team Approach to Achieving Academic Success, according to a police affidavit filed in support of charges.\n\nRelatives of another 7-year-old boy stepped forward the next day with similar complaints, the affidavit said. \n\nInvestigators said they found consistent accounts that staffers used \u201cshoulder work\u201d \u2014 including pinching pressure points on the neck, placing children in holds with their arms crossed in front of them and pushing knees into students\u2019 backs \u2014 as a way of gaining physical compliance, the affidavit said.\n\nNine defendants alleged to have abused or had physical contact with children were charged with conspiracy, simple assault, unlawful restraint, false imprisonment, endangering the welfare of a child and failure to report endangering the welfare of a child, the DA\u2019s office said.\n\nEleven defendants were charged with failure to report the alleged endangerment. Three of those charged with failure to report are school employees and were placed on leave pending further investigation, the school said in a statement.\n\nBoth groups of defendants include people with multiple counts of each charge. Police indicated a \u201cdean of students\u201d and \u201cteachers\u201d were among the second group.\n\nOn its website, the school lists the dean of students as Dahkeem Williams. \n\n\u201cWe take great exception to the District Attorney\u2019s statement that \u2018all the adults charged are equally guilty in failing to protect these children,\u2019\u201d Williams\u2019 attorney, who also represents another defendant in the case, told NBC Philadelphia.\n\n\nNone of those charged were in custody, but some have made arrangements to surrender, Stollsteimer\u2019s office said in its statement.\n\nOnline court records did not list attorneys for most defendants. The public defender\u2019s office for Delaware County did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday night.\n\n\u201cI am proud that today we are holding the support staff, teachers, and even a dean of students accountable for abusing or failing to report the abuse, of vulnerable children,\u201d Chester Township Police Chief Kenneth Coalson said in the DA\u2019s statement.\n\nStollsteimer noted that state law mandates reporting child abuse for those who work in school settings.\n\nIndividual incidents of using physical contact for compliance must each be reported under state regulations, and none were, according to the affidavit. \n\n\u201cThis is just unacceptable behavior to happen anywhere, but particularly in a school setting for children who are supposed to be getting emotional support,\u201d Stollsteimer said.\n\nThe school parent-teacher association did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday night.\n\nThe contractor for whom the DA said most of the defendants work, Peak Performers Staffing LLC, did not respond to a request for comment. Chester Community Charter School said it severed ties with the company and its workers.\n\nThe school said in a statement that 17 of those charged work for Peak Performers, which it said took over a previous, \u201chighly reputable\u201d contractor\u2019s emotional support work after that contractor discontinued the services the school was using.\n\nThe school said it was assured the Peak Performers employees were properly trained in physical contact with students but later learned they had not completed the necessary training.\n\nThe school characterized itself as an unnamed victim in the case, saying it was \u201cduped\u201d by Peak Performers.\n\n\u201cCCCS plans to pursue all appropriate legal recourse against Peak Performers for the reckless and dangerous manner in which it operated,\u201d the school said. \u201cCCCS leaders are outraged at the actions and inactions of Peak Performers and stands in solidarity with the other victims.\u201d \n\nIn 2018, Chester Community Charter School said it was the largest brick-and-mortar charter school in Pennsylvania. The K-8, four-campus school says it serves more than 4,000 students. Chester Township is about 22 miles southwest of Center City Philadelphia.",
