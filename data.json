According to his lawyers, the Trump administration appears to be seeking his removal from the country under the same legal provision that it is using to detain another recent Columbia student and Palestinian, Mahmoud Khalil, contending that his presence is a threat to the foreign policy and national security interests of the United States. Immigration officials have argued that pro-Palestinian demonstrators have enabled the spread of antisemitism, but they have not offered evidence to substantiate the claim.\n\nThis is the real issue. Rubio can just say this guy\u2019s presence harms our foreign policy agenda and SCOTUS has already said a judge can\u2019t overrule that or challenge it in any way, despite Rubio not presenting any evidence to support it. \n\nSo, once again, if the government says you\u2019re a terrorist, they can deport you without any evidence of that, and ~~SCOTUS has affirmed that somehow that\u2019s legal and constitutional!~~\n\nEDIT: Clarifying one point (corrected above) - SCOTUS has not (yet) ruled on Khalil\u2019s case, that was a judge in Louisiana.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is sometimes an infection to be found in brain tumors, but not in the surrounding non-tumor brain tissues (IE healthy ones).  So, if you can turn your immune system against CMV, you can by proxy target brain tumors (Glioblastomas specifically). And it turns out that most adults (40+) are CMV+.

At least the U.S. part. \n\nEven putting aside all the morally repugnant and flat out idiotic shit the U.S. government is currently doing, why would I commit so much time and money to a holiday plan that could be destroyed in an instant if I run into a power-tripping border official who doesn't like what they see when they go through my phone or social media? Fuck that noise.",

Then it\u2019s like 5 paragraphs replaying the old story. Since this news story is shit. I\u2019ll guess it was someone trying to get their claim coverage and they called the cops on them.",
