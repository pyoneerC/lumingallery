The Washington State Supreme Court ruled in February that they can be\u00a0identified\u00a0and that they haven't shown that public release of their names violates their right to privacy. The state supreme court denied reconsideration earlier this month and lawyers for the four officers submitted a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court, asking that the names remain protected during their legal challenge.\u00a0\n\nFour officers who attended events in the nation\u2019s capital on the day of an insurrection claimed they are protected under the state\u2019s public records law. They say they did nothing wrong and that revealing their names\u00a0would violate their privacy.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021 events, the Seattle Police Department ordered an investigation into whether any of its officers who traveled to Washington, D.C. to attend the rally had violated any laws or department policies.\n\nThe investigation found that married officers Caitlin and Alexander Everett crossed barriers set up by the Capitol police and were next to the Capitol Building, in violation of the law,\u00a0prompting Diaz to fire the pair. Investigators said three other officers had not violated policies and the fourth case was ruled \u201cinconclusive.\u201d\n\nSam Sueoka, a law student at the time, filed records requests seeking disclosure of the investigation's records for the participating officers.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe are reviewing the Does' motion for a stay,\u201d Neil Fox, one of the Sueoka's attorneys, said in an email to The Associated Press Saturday.\u00a0\n\nRequiring the officers to use their real names in the litigation would create a chilling effect on voicing unpopular opinions, the\u00a0petition\u00a0to the Supreme Court said.\u00a0\n\n\u201cAt its core, this appeal involves whether a government agency can ignore the chilling effect resulting from an employer requiring an employee to disclose their off-duty political activities and attendant impressions or motivations associated therewith, followed by widespread dissemination to those who deliberately seek this information to subject these public servants to vilification without the commission of any misconduct whatsoever,\u201d the petition said.\u00a0\n\nA response to the petition is due next week on Friday.",

The Washington State Supreme Court ruled in February that they can be\u00a0identified\u00a0and that they haven't shown that public release of their names violates their right to privacy. The state supreme court denied reconsideration earlier this month and lawyers for the four officers submitted a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court, asking that the names remain protected during their legal challenge.\u00a0\n\nFour officers who attended events in the nation\u2019s capital on the day of an insurrection claimed they are protected under the state\u2019s public records law. They say they did nothing wrong and that revealing their names\u00a0would violate their privacy.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021 events, the Seattle Police Department ordered an investigation into whether any of its officers who traveled to Washington, D.C. to attend the rally had violated any laws or department policies.\n\nThe investigation found that married officers Caitlin and Alexander Everett crossed barriers set up by the Capitol police and were next to the Capitol Building, in violation of the law,\u00a0prompting Diaz to fire the pair. Investigators said three other officers had not violated policies and the fourth case was ruled \u201cinconclusive.\u201d\n\nSam Sueoka, a law student at the time, filed records requests seeking disclosure of the investigation's records for the participating officers.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe are reviewing the Does' motion for a stay,\u201d Neil Fox, one of the Sueoka's attorneys, said in an email to The Associated Press Saturday.\u00a0\n\nRequiring the officers to use their real names in the litigation would create a chilling effect on voicing unpopular opinions, the\u00a0petition\u00a0to the Supreme Court said.\u00a0\n\n\u201cAt its core, this appeal involves whether a government agency can ignore the chilling effect resulting from an employer requiring an employee to disclose their off-duty political activities and attendant impressions or motivations associated therewith, followed by widespread dissemination to those who deliberately seek this information to subject these public servants to vilification without the commission of any misconduct whatsoever,\u201d the petition said.\u00a0\n\nA response to the petition is due next week on Friday.",

The Washington State Supreme Court ruled in February that they can be\u00a0identified\u00a0and that they haven't shown that public release of their names violates their right to privacy. The state supreme court denied reconsideration earlier this month and lawyers for the four officers submitted a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court, asking that the names remain protected during their legal challenge.\u00a0\n\nFour officers who attended events in the nation\u2019s capital on the day of an insurrection claimed they are protected under the state\u2019s public records law. They say they did nothing wrong and that revealing their names\u00a0would violate their privacy.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021 events, the Seattle Police Department ordered an investigation into whether any of its officers who traveled to Washington, D.C. to attend the rally had violated any laws or department policies.\n\nThe investigation found that married officers Caitlin and Alexander Everett crossed barriers set up by the Capitol police and were next to the Capitol Building, in violation of the law,\u00a0prompting Diaz to fire the pair. Investigators said three other officers had not violated policies and the fourth case was ruled \u201cinconclusive.\u201d\n\nSam Sueoka, a law student at the time, filed records requests seeking disclosure of the investigation's records for the participating officers.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe are reviewing the Does' motion for a stay,\u201d Neil Fox, one of the Sueoka's attorneys, said in an email to The Associated Press Saturday.\u00a0\n\nRequiring the officers to use their real names in the litigation would create a chilling effect on voicing unpopular opinions, the\u00a0petition\u00a0to the Supreme Court said.\u00a0\n\n\u201cAt its core, this appeal involves whether a government agency can ignore the chilling effect resulting from an employer requiring an employee to disclose their off-duty political activities and attendant impressions or motivations associated therewith, followed by widespread dissemination to those who deliberately seek this information to subject these public servants to vilification without the commission of any misconduct whatsoever,\u201d the petition said.\u00a0\n\nA response to the petition is due next week on Friday.",
