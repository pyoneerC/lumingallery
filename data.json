Only the victim is alive, and nobody connected with assault is at the facility anymore. Most organizations (school districts for example) have insurance for when things need a big payout like this, but you can\u2019t get insurance to pay out for sexual assaults in these cases as the insuring organization when the crime was committed have been gone out of business and current insurance plans do not cover this kind of crime.  That means the payout comes from a general fund, the same fund that they pay their employees from and where they find money to fix facilities. \n\nI\u2019m not denying the heinous nature of the crimes these sexual assault survivors have had to endure, or the long term effects of those acts, how it likely played a role in many of not all of their actions and decisions since. But in many cases nobody connected with the crimes works for the organization anymore and hasn\u2019t been for decades, but they are left with the bill. \n\nBecause of these cases there has been a significant shortfall in funding for nurses, teachers and other affected industries as they have had to pay out millions to victims that would have otherwise gone to increase pay for their staff. \n\nI am not trying to diminish anyone\u2019s suffering but it\u2019s like someone saying they were assaulted in a house 50 years ago and even though you moved in 5 years ago you\u2019re responsible for crime because you live there now.\n\n\nSource: I am a school board member in a small district (we thankfully have not had an cases of SA) who participated in a legislative advocacy and AB 218 was one of the bills we discussed",

Only the victim is alive, and nobody connected with assault is at the facility anymore. Most organizations (school districts for example) have insurance for when things need a big payout like this, but you can\u2019t get insurance to pay out for sexual assaults in these cases as the insuring organization when the crime was committed have been gone out of business and current insurance plans do not cover this kind of crime.  That means the payout comes from a general fund, the same fund that they pay their employees from and where they find money to fix facilities. \n\nI\u2019m not denying the heinous nature of the crimes these sexual assault survivors have had to endure, or the long term effects of those acts, how it likely played a role in many of not all of their actions and decisions since. But in many cases nobody connected with the crimes works for the organization anymore and hasn\u2019t been for decades, but they are left with the bill. \n\nBecause of these cases there has been a significant shortfall in funding for nurses, teachers and other affected industries as they have had to pay out millions to victims that would have otherwise gone to increase pay for their staff. \n\nI am not trying to diminish anyone\u2019s suffering but it\u2019s like someone saying they were assaulted in a house 50 years ago and even though you moved in 5 years ago you\u2019re responsible for crime because you live there now.\n\n\nSource: I am a school board member in a small district (we thankfully have not had an cases of SA) who participated in a legislative advocacy and AB 218 was one of the bills we discussed",

Only the victim is alive, and nobody connected with assault is at the facility anymore. Most organizations (school districts for example) have insurance for when things need a big payout like this, but you can\u2019t get insurance to pay out for sexual assaults in these cases as the insuring organization when the crime was committed have been gone out of business and current insurance plans do not cover this kind of crime.  That means the payout comes from a general fund, the same fund that they pay their employees from and where they find money to fix facilities. \n\nI\u2019m not denying the heinous nature of the crimes these sexual assault survivors have had to endure, or the long term effects of those acts, how it likely played a role in many of not all of their actions and decisions since. But in many cases nobody connected with the crimes works for the organization anymore and hasn\u2019t been for decades, but they are left with the bill. \n\nBecause of these cases there has been a significant shortfall in funding for nurses, teachers and other affected industries as they have had to pay out millions to victims that would have otherwise gone to increase pay for their staff. \n\nI am not trying to diminish anyone\u2019s suffering but it\u2019s like someone saying they were assaulted in a house 50 years ago and even though you moved in 5 years ago you\u2019re responsible for crime because you live there now.\n\n\nSource: I am a school board member in a small district (we thankfully have not had an cases of SA) who participated in a legislative advocacy and AB 218 was one of the bills we discussed",
