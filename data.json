                "I found a way over here via enrolling in a masters program. Might not be permanent, but I\u2019m working on rolling it into a grad visa and then maybe stay via a skilled worker visa. Wish there were better options for bailing out of the US. So many people living there hate what is happening and simply don\u2019t have the resources to leave or the agency to change it.",

                "My fianc\u00e9 works completely remote, and we were considering the 'digital nomad' lifestyle, it's just *insanely* expensive in the UK compared to where we currently live. We also considered New Zealand, but it's too difficult to get in.",

                "Guy's a massive trumper. While I oppose his arrest and possible deportation on principle, I don't exactly feel bad for him. This is exactly ~~what he voted for~~ the policy he supports. He just didn't think it would happen to him \\[because he's white\\].",
                "And there won\u2019t be any Medicaid for his 5 anchor babies after he\u2019s deported.  His wife voted for Trump, he stumped for Trump.  When he had an expired green card. \n\n#FAFO",

                "I'm not saying that any of these detentions are justified. But it has been common practice for years to send people in his position to immigration court for removal proceedings. He was required by law to apply for removal of conditions on his residence at the two-year mark. With children and a life together with his USC spouse, it would have been an easy approval, might not have even required an interview. When he didn't file the petition that is required of *everyone* in his position, he opened himself up to this possibility. It's a three-page application. Now a judge has to sort it out while his family is in limbo."
