                "OKLAHOMA CITY (KFOR) \u2014 A woman says her family\u2019s fresh start in Oklahoma turned into a nightmare after federal immigration agents raided their home, **taking their phones, laptops, and life savings** \u2013 even though they were not the suspects the agents were looking for.\n\nThe agents had a search warrant for the home, but **the suspects listed on the warrant do not live in the house**.\n\nThe woman who actually lives in the house had just moved to Oklahoma City from Maryland with her family about two weeks earlier..\n\n\"I said you took my phone. We have no money. I just moved here,\u201d the mother said. \u201cI have to feed my children. I\u2019m going to need gas money. I need to be able to get around. Like, how do you just leave me like this? Like an abandoned dog.\u201d\n\nShe said the agents ordered her and her daughters to step outside, even though it was raining and they barely were given time to put on clothes.\n\n\u201c**They wanted me to change in front of all of them, in between all of them**,\u201d she said. \u201cMy husband has not even seen my daughter in her undergarments \u2014 her own dad, because it\u2019s respectful. **You have her out there, a minor, in her underwear,**\u201d the woman told KFOR.\n\n\u201cOne of them said, \u2018I know it was a little rough this morning,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt was so denigrating. That you do all of this to a family, to women, your fellow citizens. And it was a little rough? You literally traumatized me and my daughters for life. We\u2019re going to have to go get help or get over this somehow.\u201d\n\nBefore the agents left, the mother asked when could the family get their belongings back and they said **it could be days or even months,** KFOR reported.\n\nEdit: Other news sources clarified that **20 men** broke into the house in the middle of the night while they were sleeping. So 20 men surrounded this woman and her three young daughters, dragged them out into the rain in their underwear, and made them change clothes in front of them. If there was any justice in this  country they would be up on charges of sexual exploitation of minors.\n\n2nd Edit: The ~~agents~~ stasi thugs wouldn't even leave a business card or phone number they could call to find out how to get their electronics and life savings back. The ~~agents~~ thieves refused to even tell them which government agency or department would be storing their property.",

                "Law enforcement needs to be held accountable\n\nEven if you could agree with what ICE is trying to do, any law enforcement agency should be heavily penalized for raiding the wrong goddamn house!\n\nLike are you fucking serious?

We have no money. I just moved here,\u201d the mother said. \u201cI have to feed my children. I\u2019m going to need gas money. I need to be able to get around. Like, how do you just leave me like this? Like an abandoned dog.\u201d\n\nShe said the agents ordered her and her daughters to step outside, even though it was raining and they barely were given time to put on clothes.\n\n\u201c**They wanted me to change in front of all of them, in between all of them**,\u201d she said. \u201cMy husband has not even seen my daughter in her undergarments \u2014 her own dad, because it\u2019s respectful. **You have her out there, a minor, in her underwear,**\u201d the woman told KFOR.\n\n\u201cOne of them said, \u2018I know it was a little rough this morning,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt was so denigrating. That you do all of this to a family, to women, your fellow citizens. And it was a little rough? You literally traumatized me and my daughters for life. We\u2019re going to have to go get help or get over this somehow.\u201d\n\nBefore the agents left, the mother asked when could the family get their belongings back and they said **it could be days or even months,** KFOR reported.\n\nEdit: Other news sources clarified that **20 men** broke into the house in the middle of the night while they were sleeping. So 20 men surrounded this woman and her three young daughters, dragged them out into the rain in their underwear, and made them change clothes in front of them. If there was any justice in this  country they would be up on charges of sexual exploitation of minors.\n\n2nd Edit: The ~~agents~~ stasi thugs wouldn't even leave a business card or phone number they could call to find out how to get their electronics and life savings back. The ~~agents~~ thieves refused to even tell them which government agency or department would be storing their property.",

We have no money. I just moved here,\u201d the mother said. \u201cI have to feed my children. I\u2019m going to need gas money. I need to be able to get around. Like, how do you just leave me like this? Like an abandoned dog.\u201d\n\nShe said the agents ordered her and her daughters to step outside, even though it was raining and they barely were given time to put on clothes.\n\n\u201c**They wanted me to change in front of all of them, in between all of them**,\u201d she said. \u201cMy husband has not even seen my daughter in her undergarments \u2014 her own dad, because it\u2019s respectful. **You have her out there, a minor, in her underwear,**\u201d the woman told KFOR.\n\n\u201cOne of them said, \u2018I know it was a little rough this morning,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt was so denigrating.

We\u2019re going to have to go get help or get over this somehow.\u201d\n\nBefore the agents left, the mother asked when could the family get their belongings back and they said **it could be days or even months,** KFOR reported.\n\nEdit: Other news sources clarified that **20 men** broke into the house in the middle of the night while they were sleeping. So 20 men surrounded this woman and her three young daughters, dragged them out into the rain in their underwear, and made them change clothes in front of them.

It would be foolish to think that all of it will come back under the control of Ukraine, but now there is a clear reason to support Ukraine in taking back some of it. \n\nUnfortunately for Ukraine, this does equate to a loss of some level of sovereignty.
