The agency said there were popping sounds on an unspecified number of radio frequencies. While air traffic controllers were able to communicate with aircraft, the radio system was not working correctly, prompting the switch to a backup system, the FAA said.\n\n>The incident marks the fourth time in the past two weeks that technical problems have disrupted air traffic at Newark Liberty.\n\n>On Friday morning, [radar screens at the airport went black](https://abcnews.go.com/US/radar-screens-newark-airport-black-overnight/story?id=121638395) for approximately 90 seconds, according to the FAA. During the outage, which occurred at about 3:55 a.m. ET, air traffic controllers could be heard telling a FedEx plane that their screens had gone dark and then asking the aircraft to tell their company to apply pressure to get the problem fixed.\n\n>In another transmission, a controller told an arriving private jet that the airport just had experienced a brief radar outage and to stay at or above 3,000 feet in case the controllers couldn't get in touch during the aircraft's descent.\n\n>The FAA said that the Friday outage stemmed from a \"telecommunications outage that impacted communications and radar display at Philadelphia TRACON Area C,\" which is the facility that covers the airspace around Newark.\n\n>On April 28, an [outage at Newark Liberty](https://abcnews.go.com/US/newark-airport-outage-week-lasted-60-90-seconds/story?id=121484044) caused air traffic control computer screens to go dark for roughly 60 to 90 seconds and also prevented the controllers from talking to aircraft during the outage, multiple sources with knowledge of the incident told ABC News. As a result, the FAA halted all departures to the Newark airport, citing \"telecommunications and equipment issues at Philadelphia TRACON.\"\n\n>ABC News also confirmed a minor outage at Newark Liberty that occurred on April 30.\n\n>Following the April 29 outage, several controllers went on medical leave, calling the experience a traumatic event.

                "*Article Text by Jennifer Ludden:* \n\nThe Food and Drug administration has approved the U.S.'s first at-home alternative to the Pap smear, a procedure generations of women have dreaded and often found painful.\n\nThe new device by Teal Health will offer a \"much preferred experience,\" the company said in its announcement, and also aims to increase screening rates by making the procedure more convenient.\n\nTraditionally, gynecologists have inserted a cold metal speculum deep into a woman's vagina to scrape cells from the cervix.\n\nThe Teal Wand \u2014 \"built with empathy,\" the company said \u2014 uses a swab to collect a vaginal sample. Women will then mail the sample to a lab that will screen for HPV (human papillomavirus), the virus that causes nearly all cervical cancers. A growing body of research has found HPV testing to be highly accurate.\n\nThe FDA approval Friday follows a U.S.-based study that found at-home screening was just as effective as that done in a doctor's office. The study also found women overwhelmingly preferred self\u2013screening at home, and said they'd be more likely to stay up to date with cervical cancer screenings that way.\n\nEvery year, about 13,000 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed, and more than 4,000 women die from the disease. Rates are down dramatically since Dr. Georgios Papanicolaou published a 1943 paper on how to use the Pap smear for screening, and it then became common.\n\nBut about a quarter of women in the U.S. are behind on such screenings, and medical experts say reducing that is key to the ultimate goal of eliminating cervical cancer. There's also a racial gap, with Black and Native American women far more likely to die from cervical cancer than white women. The HPV vaccine for teen and preteen girls, introduced in 2007, has also led to a global push to tackle the disease that way.\n\nAt-home cervical cancer screenings are already available in several other countries, including Australia and Sweden.\n\nTeal Health says its self-testing device will be available starting next month, in California first and then expanding. It will be by prescription, through a telehealth service, for women 25-65 years old who are \"at average risk.\" The company says it's working with insurance companies to provide coverage.",

She literally jumped back from me and treated me like I was diseased. The HPV test was negative. I never went back to her and the last I heard she moved to the urgent care clinic where she belongs.",

To survive, they had to \u201ctake rusted water out of the engine (and) when a fish passed by, they caught it and parboiled it to eat.\u201d Fares added that they also drank rain and sea water to survive.\n\n>The men are in stable condition and the navy said it is coordinating with local and foreign authorities to ensure their safe return to their respective countries.\n\n>Earlier this year, another Peruvian fisherman, 61-year-old M\u00e1ximo Napa, spent [95 days](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/18/americas/peruvian-fisherman-lost-at-sea-survived-intl-latam/index.html) at sea alone. He was also rescued by an Ecuadorian vessel and returned to Lima in mid-March to be reunited with his family.",

The agency said there were popping sounds on an unspecified number of radio frequencies. While air traffic controllers were able to communicate with aircraft, the radio system was not working correctly, prompting the switch to a backup system, the FAA said.\n\n>The incident marks the fourth time in the past two weeks that technical problems have disrupted air traffic at Newark Liberty.\n\n>On Friday morning, [radar screens at the airport went black](https://abcnews.go.com/US/radar-screens-newark-airport-black-overnight/story?id=121638395) for approximately 90 seconds, according to the FAA.

As a result, the FAA halted all departures to the Newark airport, citing \"telecommunications and equipment issues at Philadelphia TRACON.\"\n\n>ABC News also confirmed a minor outage at Newark Liberty that occurred on April 30.\n\n>Following the April 29 outage, several controllers went on medical leave, calling the experience a traumatic event.

                "Article by Bill Hutchinson\n\n>At least one person was killed and 32 others were injured in a fiery collision Sunday morning between a packed tour bus and a disabled SUV stalled on a freeway in Los Angeles County, authorities said.\n\n>The collision occurred just after 5 a.m. Pacific Time on State Route 60 near the unincorporated Los Angeles County community of Hacienda Heights east of downtown Los Angeles, according to a statement from Officer Zachary Salazar, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol.\n\n>The tour bus was carrying 63 passengers when it collided with a Nissan Pathfinder that was disabled in the westbound lanes, the CHP said in a statement. The Nissan burst into flames as a result of the collision, the statement said.\n\n>The driver of the Nissan, whose name was not immediately released, died at the scene after becoming trapped in the burning vehicle, the statement said.\n\n>The fire did not spread to the tour bus but 32 of the 63 people aboard the vehicle were taken to local hospitals for treatment of injuries, according to Salazar.\n\n>The tour bus driver, identified by the CHP as Sui Sheng Du, slammed into the rear of the disabled SUV, according to a preliminary investigation by the CHP.\n\n>\"As a result of the impact, the Nissan Pathfinder became fully engulfed in flames, trapping the occupant,\" according to the CHP statement.\n\n>Following the collision, the bus veered to the right across multiple lanes of the freeway and crashed into a raised metal and wood guardrail along the right shoulder, the CHP said.\n\n>The Los Angeles County Fire Department said two bus passengers were in critical condition and the remaining victims suffered minor to moderate injuries.\n\n>Salazar said the tour bus was heading to Koreatown in downtown Los Angeles when the crash occurred. He said the bus was coming from Morongo Valley, about 110 miles east of Los Angeles.\n\n>Images of the bus taken by ABC Los Angeles station [KABC](https://abc7.com/post/1-dead-dozens-injured-fiery-crash-between-suv-tour-bus-hacienda-heights-california-highway-patrol-says/16384161/) showed substantial front-end damage to the vehicle.\n\n>It was not immediately clear what caused the SUV to become disabled, Salazar said.\n\n>The CHP said neither alcohol nor drugs appeared to be a factor in the crash.",
                "Very odd story.  Firstly, why is a bus full of tourists heading from Moreno Valley to Downtown at 5 AM?  Secondly, the 60 being a major freeway, was the Nissan just sitting in the middle of the freeway lane or pulled over to the side, and why was the driver still in the disabled car if it was in unsafe lane?",
                "If this was freeway speeds, that bus needed approximately the length of a football field to stop, something most motorists don\u2019t know. \n\nThat is why you\u2019re taking your life in your hands when you cut off a bus at a stoplight, or pull in front with inches to spare when you should have waited. \n\nThe bus driver could have been inattentive, but it\u2019s possible he just didn\u2019t have the space to stop, & it\u2019s extremely unsafe to try to swerve at highway speeds.\n\nThis was all news to me when I trained as a bus driver & I find it ridiculously negligent that it isn\u2019t a major part of regular driver license exams. A 30 or 40 foot bus simply does not maneuver or stop like a smaller vehicle.\n\nDrivers know to slow down if traffic is slowing down, or when approaching intersections. A vehicle essentially parked in a lane of the highway is unexpected. If the bus driver was driving into the sun, they might not have seen it in time to switch lanes safely. Or, again, they could have been completely negligent, but I don\u2019t have enough information to say the bus driver was 100% at fault.",
                "That section of the 60 freeway is always clogged with traffic. I used to live right behind it in that same area",
                "So tragic. RIP Nissan driver.\n\nThis is most likely bankrupting the tour bus company. Hoping they had high-limit auto liability and a big ass commercial umbrella... even still, likely not enough coverage for this type of tragedy.",
                "We need to have yearly vehicle safety inspections. Too much crap on the roads these days.",
                "This is why you get out of your disabled vehicle and wait some distance up traffic on the shoulder.",
                "The fact that the Nissan was stalled in the lane, effectively mean it was blocking the freeway, puts a lot of the responsibility on the bus driver to be aware of what's in front of him.\n\nThe Nissan was stopped/stalled, so it wasn't just something that happened immediately in front of the bus. It was there for a period of time before the bus impacted it. \n\nWhether the bus driver paid attention to the traffic ahead will be a key consideration.\n\nBut tragic regardless of the cause.",
                "These tour busses full of Chinese tourists are so dangerous sometimes. Going at speeds no tour bus should be going because they need to get those Chinese tourists to Vegas asap or wherever they are going. I live in the area and it's pretty bad on the weekends."

I put them off as long as I can due to anxiety, clenching, and pain. I'll definitely be using this as soon as it's available.",
                "*Article Text by Jennifer Ludden:* \n\nThe Food and Drug administration has approved the U.S.'s first at-home alternative to the Pap smear, a procedure generations of women have dreaded and often found painful.\n\nThe new device by Teal Health will offer a \"much preferred experience,\" the company said in its announcement, and also aims to increase screening rates by making the procedure more convenient.\n\nTraditionally, gynecologists have inserted a cold metal speculum deep into a woman's vagina to scrape cells from the cervix.\n\nThe Teal Wand \u2014 \"built with empathy,\" the company said \u2014 uses a swab to collect a vaginal sample. Women will then mail the sample to a lab that will screen for HPV (human papillomavirus), the virus that causes nearly all cervical cancers. A growing body of research has found HPV testing to be highly accurate.\n\nThe FDA approval Friday follows a U.S.-based study that found at-home screening was just as effective as that done in a doctor's office. The study also found women overwhelmingly preferred self\u2013screening at home, and said they'd be more likely to stay up to date with cervical cancer screenings that way.\n\nEvery year, about 13,000 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed, and more than 4,000 women die from the disease. Rates are down dramatically since Dr. Georgios Papanicolaou published a 1943 paper on how to use the Pap smear for screening, and it then became common.\n\nBut about a quarter of women in the U.S. are behind on such screenings, and medical experts say reducing that is key to the ultimate goal of eliminating cervical cancer. There's also a racial gap, with Black and Native American women far more likely to die from cervical cancer than white women. The HPV vaccine for teen and preteen girls, introduced in 2007, has also led to a global push to tackle the disease that way.\n\nAt-home cervical cancer screenings are already available in several other countries, including Australia and Sweden.\n\nTeal Health says its self-testing device will be available starting next month, in California first and then expanding. It will be by prescription, through a telehealth service, for women 25-65 years old who are \"at average risk.\" The company says it's working with insurance companies to provide coverage.",

Someone else just rams it in there and the whole process doesn\u2019t go fast enough so the discomfort and pain last longer. \n\nAlso, I had an inexperienced doctor react like she was revolted because she mistook what is a backed up sebaceous gland for an HPV wart. She literally jumped back from me and treated me like I was diseased. The HPV test was negative. I never went back to her and the last I heard she moved to the urgent care clinic where she belongs.",

The agency said there were popping sounds on an unspecified number of radio frequencies. While air traffic controllers were able to communicate with aircraft, the radio system was not working correctly, prompting the switch to a backup system, the FAA said.\n\n>The incident marks the fourth time in the past two weeks that technical problems have disrupted air traffic at Newark Liberty.\n\n>On Friday morning, [radar screens at the airport went black](https://abcnews.go.com/US/radar-screens-newark-airport-black-overnight/story?id=121638395) for approximately 90 seconds, according to the FAA.

I put them off as long as I can due to anxiety, clenching, and pain. I'll definitely be using this as soon as it's available.",
                "*Article Text by Jennifer Ludden:* \n\nThe Food and Drug administration has approved the U.S.'s first at-home alternative to the Pap smear, a procedure generations of women have dreaded and often found painful.\n\nThe new device by Teal Health will offer a \"much preferred experience,\" the company said in its announcement, and also aims to increase screening rates by making the procedure more convenient.\n\nTraditionally, gynecologists have inserted a cold metal speculum deep into a woman's vagina to scrape cells from the cervix.\n\nThe Teal Wand \u2014 \"built with empathy,\" the company said \u2014 uses a swab to collect a vaginal sample. Women will then mail the sample to a lab that will screen for HPV (human papillomavirus), the virus that causes nearly all cervical cancers. A growing body of research has found HPV testing to be highly accurate.\n\nThe FDA approval Friday follows a U.S.-based study that found at-home screening was just as effective as that done in a doctor's office. The study also found women overwhelmingly preferred self\u2013screening at home, and said they'd be more likely to stay up to date with cervical cancer screenings that way.\n\nEvery year, about 13,000 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed, and more than 4,000 women die from the disease. Rates are down dramatically since Dr. Georgios Papanicolaou published a 1943 paper on how to use the Pap smear for screening, and it then became common.\n\nBut about a quarter of women in the U.S. are behind on such screenings, and medical experts say reducing that is key to the ultimate goal of eliminating cervical cancer. There's also a racial gap, with Black and Native American women far more likely to die from cervical cancer than white women. The HPV vaccine for teen and preteen girls, introduced in 2007, has also led to a global push to tackle the disease that way.\n\nAt-home cervical cancer screenings are already available in several other countries, including Australia and Sweden.\n\nTeal Health says its self-testing device will be available starting next month, in California first and then expanding. It will be by prescription, through a telehealth service, for women 25-65 years old who are \"at average risk.\" The company says it's working with insurance companies to provide coverage.",

She literally jumped back from me and treated me like I was diseased. The HPV test was negative. I never went back to her and the last I heard she moved to the urgent care clinic where she belongs.",

The Nissan burst into flames as a result of the collision, the statement said.\n\n>The driver of the Nissan, whose name was not immediately released, died at the scene after becoming trapped in the burning vehicle, the statement said.\n\n>The fire did not spread to the tour bus but 32 of the 63 people aboard the vehicle were taken to local hospitals for treatment of injuries, according to Salazar.\n\n>The tour bus driver, identified by the CHP as Sui Sheng Du, slammed into the rear of the disabled SUV, according to a preliminary investigation by the CHP.\n\n>\"As a result of the impact, the Nissan Pathfinder became fully engulfed in flames, trapping the occupant,\" according to the CHP statement.\n\n>Following the collision, the bus veered to the right across multiple lanes of the freeway and crashed into a raised metal and wood guardrail along the right shoulder, the CHP said.\n\n>The Los Angeles County Fire Department said two bus passengers were in critical condition and the remaining victims suffered minor to moderate injuries.\n\n>Salazar said the tour bus was heading to Koreatown in downtown Los Angeles when the crash occurred. He said the bus was coming from Morongo Valley, about 110 miles east of Los Angeles.\n\n>Images of the bus taken by ABC Los Angeles station [KABC](https://abc7.com/post/1-dead-dozens-injured-fiery-crash-between-suv-tour-bus-hacienda-heights-california-highway-patrol-says/16384161/) showed substantial front-end damage to the vehicle.\n\n>It was not immediately clear what caused the SUV to become disabled, Salazar said.\n\n>The CHP said neither alcohol nor drugs appeared to be a factor in the crash.",
                "Very odd story.  Firstly, why is a bus full of tourists heading from Moreno Valley to Downtown at 5 AM?  Secondly, the 60 being a major freeway, was the Nissan just sitting in the middle of the freeway lane or pulled over to the side, and why was the driver still in the disabled car if it was in unsafe lane?",
                "If this was freeway speeds, that bus needed approximately the length of a football field to stop, something most motorists don\u2019t know. \n\nThat is why you\u2019re taking your life in your hands when you cut off a bus at a stoplight, or pull in front with inches to spare when you should have waited. \n\nThe bus driver could have been inattentive, but it\u2019s possible he just didn\u2019t have the space to stop, & it\u2019s extremely unsafe to try to swerve at highway speeds.\n\nThis was all news to me when I trained as a bus driver & I find it ridiculously negligent that it isn\u2019t a major part of regular driver license exams. A 30 or 40 foot bus simply does not maneuver or stop like a smaller vehicle.\n\nDrivers know to slow down if traffic is slowing down, or when approaching intersections. A vehicle essentially parked in a lane of the highway is unexpected. If the bus driver was driving into the sun, they might not have seen it in time to switch lanes safely. Or, again, they could have been completely negligent, but I don\u2019t have enough information to say the bus driver was 100% at fault.",

                "This is why you get out of your disabled vehicle and wait some distance up traffic on the shoulder.",
                "The fact that the Nissan was stalled in the lane, effectively mean it was blocking the freeway, puts a lot of the responsibility on the bus driver to be aware of what's in front of him.\n\nThe Nissan was stopped/stalled, so it wasn't just something that happened immediately in front of the bus. It was there for a period of time before the bus impacted it. \n\nWhether the bus driver paid attention to the traffic ahead will be a key consideration.\n\nBut tragic regardless of the cause.",
