Are the cops asking for the immigration status of everyone they pull over? Was she driving without a DL which triggers inquiry and then ICE arrives to detain her while they figure out if she's legal? Same with her father who got pulled over going 19mph over the limit. For most people, this is a ticket and then you go home. What is going on between them getting pulled over and detained so they end up with ICE? Because ICE can't pull people over.\n\nThere is no central registry of citizens. The only documents which prove your citizenship are your passport, naturalization certificate, or birth certificate, which most people don't carry with them at all times..

                "Police in Sydney routinely conduct invasive strip searches at music festivals. These are completely naked searches where guys are told to lift their balls, girls are told to lift their boobs, attendees are told to squat and cough, bend over etc. Most of these strip searches don\u2019t find any drugs, and you\u2019ve got reports of innocent people being left completely distraught after this has happened to them. NSW Police are currently facing a class action over this. So far around 3000 people have signed up. A trial for that class action began last week. \n\nFor background: In 2001, New South Wales (state in Australia, Sydney is the capital) introduced a law giving police the power to deploy drug detection dogs at certain public locations, namely at major events such as music festivals, train stations and at venues that serve alcohol, such as pubs and clubs. These dogs are notoriously unreliable, and there are reports on social media of handlers forcing their dogs to sit in front people in order to have them searched.\n\nIt's just crazy. You can turn up to a train station in Sydney and there\u2019ll be a dozen officers standing around watching while a dog is sniffing commuters. Same deal at pubs. You can be having a beer and all of a sudden the police will burst in and block off all the exits so a dog can be brought round to sniff everyone. They used to do this every weekend picking clubs and pubs at random. \n\nMusic festivals are the worst. The police have drug detection dogs at every music festival in Sydney. At these events, they\u2019ll have a fenced off compound setup with makeshift structures such as tents or ticket booths where people stopped by the dogs are taken to be searched. Some people are lucky enough to get away with a pat down, but in many cases, festival attendees have been ordered to strip completely naked and bend over, squat etc. to have their bodies examined for drugs. At any given event, they\u2019ll strip search dozens of people like this. Total gestapo stuff and it\u2019s still happening today.",
                "How are Australians ok with something like this? People do tons of drugs at American music festivals and we seem to be doing fine.",
                "Being strip searched is a major violation. It's insane that you can just be an ordinary person doing nothing wrong and police can make you strip based on the an alert from a dog that they know is usually wrong. And for what? They're usually not even looking for major drug operations. Just people with drugs, probably mostly for their own personal use. I'm way more concerned about sex crimes than drug use, and in this case, the police are committing them. Or they would be, if the law didn't give them a special exception.",
                "I lived in Sydney 20 years ago and it was frightening how the police behaved. Sitting in a pub in the afternoon and having a gang of armed police in militaristic uniforms go from table to table with an alsatian sniffing everybody while the cops glare at you like they're trying their best to catch you out or bait you into challenging them so they can beat you down... it's grim, man. Proper police state behaviour. You quickly learn to hate seeing police in the streets, which is very different from my experience in the UK.",

This means both in the people you elect, and the actions you do. For many boycotting/protesting the venues that do this matters far less than seeing the big show done by a band they've made a huge part of their own self-identity.\n\nOf course this politics and involves the government, but if people stop showing up to the biggest venues in the city in protest to this, the venue owners will go to local politicians and push serious money to get it changed.\n\nEverything is politics, even music festivals, and your own attendance to them.",

What is going on between them getting pulled over and detained so they end up with ICE? Because ICE can't pull people over.\n\nThere is no central registry of citizens.

I can guarantee that the permit review will miss major permits required, let alone bother with technical safety and feasibility reviews. If anyone has thought to put a waiver of liability on the permitting process, it will fall on the permit holder. \n\nMining is a huge business, but it also can have significant consequences when unchecked. I guess we're making Superfund sites great again?",

                "As a result, the project's environmental review will be completed in just 14 days, the department said in a statement. Such studies typically take years because of the potential environmental effects of uranium mining.\n\nWell, that's not terrifying at all given the substance involved. I mean, I'm sure the mining industry has a proven track record of safety and environmental concerns being addressed. *Shaking head*",

                "Police in Sydney routinely conduct invasive strip searches at music festivals. These are completely naked searches where guys are told to lift their balls, girls are told to lift their boobs, attendees are told to squat and cough, bend over etc. Most of these strip searches don\u2019t find any drugs, and you\u2019ve got reports of innocent people being left completely distraught after this has happened to them. NSW Police are currently facing a class action over this. So far around 3000 people have signed up. A trial for that class action began last week. \n\nFor background: In 2001, New South Wales (state in Australia, Sydney is the capital) introduced a law giving police the power to deploy drug detection dogs at certain public locations, namely at major events such as music festivals, train stations and at venues that serve alcohol, such as pubs and clubs. These dogs are notoriously unreliable, and there are reports on social media of handlers forcing their dogs to sit in front people in order to have them searched.\n\nIt's just crazy. You can turn up to a train station in Sydney and there\u2019ll be a dozen officers standing around watching while a dog is sniffing commuters. Same deal at pubs. You can be having a beer and all of a sudden the police will burst in and block off all the exits so a dog can be brought round to sniff everyone. They used to do this every weekend picking clubs and pubs at random. \n\nMusic festivals are the worst. The police have drug detection dogs at every music festival in Sydney. At these events, they\u2019ll have a fenced off compound setup with makeshift structures such as tents or ticket booths where people stopped by the dogs are taken to be searched. Some people are lucky enough to get away with a pat down, but in many cases, festival attendees have been ordered to strip completely naked and bend over, squat etc. to have their bodies examined for drugs. At any given event, they\u2019ll strip search dozens of people like this. Total gestapo stuff and it\u2019s still happening today.",
                "How are Australians ok with something like this? People do tons of drugs at American music festivals and we seem to be doing fine.",
                "Being strip searched is a major violation. It's insane that you can just be an ordinary person doing nothing wrong and police can make you strip based on the an alert from a dog that they know is usually wrong. And for what? They're usually not even looking for major drug operations. Just people with drugs, probably mostly for their own personal use. I'm way more concerned about sex crimes than drug use, and in this case, the police are committing them. Or they would be, if the law didn't give them a special exception.",
                "I lived in Sydney 20 years ago and it was frightening how the police behaved. Sitting in a pub in the afternoon and having a gang of armed police in militaristic uniforms go from table to table with an alsatian sniffing everybody while the cops glare at you like they're trying their best to catch you out or bait you into challenging them so they can beat you down... it's grim, man. Proper police state behaviour. You quickly learn to hate seeing police in the streets, which is very different from my experience in the UK.",

This means both in the people you elect, and the actions you do. For many boycotting/protesting the venues that do this matters far less than seeing the big show done by a band they've made a huge part of their own self-identity.\n\nOf course this politics and involves the government, but if people stop showing up to the biggest venues in the city in protest to this, the venue owners will go to local politicians and push serious money to get it changed.\n\nEverything is politics, even music festivals, and your own attendance to them.",
