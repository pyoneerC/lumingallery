There's also the simpler fact that, due the nature of *how* illegal immigrants file their taxes, any attempt to scoop them up through the IRS data is going to scoop up a *lot* of US citizens that happen to \"fit the profile\" assuming they maintain their current \"move fast and break things\" attitude about civil rights.",

                "This is going to be bad for the budget. Currently the fact that the IRS promises not to share data with immigration enforcement for people who voluntarily report taxes is responsible for almost $100b in revenue from people who can't claim most benefits of their tax dollars. Letting these people pay taxes benefits other taxpayers and breaking this trust just vindicates those who chose to hide their income.\n\nIt seems (numbers aren't forthcoming) that the administration never intended to follow through on its promise of targeting criminals first, because those engaging with the system in good faith (going to all their immigration/asylum hearings, paying their taxes, etc.) are easier to track down to pad the numbers.",
                "I cannot stress how horrifically stupid this decision is because at the end of the day, the IRS must be an apolitical agency to even function; the moment your tax statements can be used for political persecution of any kind, is a moment where the entire tax system collapses.\n\nNever mind the fact that illegal immigrants who pay into social security through fake identities are literally a net benefit to social security because they can't collect those benefits so its just a positive to the system (still messed up to be clear, but its the reality of our situation).\n\nThere's only one reason to do this sort of thing: to further the collapse of social security and sow immense distrust in the American taxation system for income tax. There's also the simpler fact that, due the nature of *how* illegal immigrants file their taxes, any attempt to scoop them up through the IRS data is going to scoop up a *lot* of US citizens that happen to \"fit the profile\" assuming they maintain their current \"move fast and break things\" attitude about civil rights.",
