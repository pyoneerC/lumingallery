                "From the article: \"A former New Mexico judge has been arrested on an evidence tampering charge for allegedly destroying a phone belonging to a tenant who is accused of keeping guns at the property and suspected of being a member of a Venezuelan criminal gang.\n\nFederal authorities said in court records that former Do\u00f1a Ana County Magistrate Judge Jose Luis \u201cJoel\u201d Cano, who was arrested Thursday, told investigators that he believed photos or videos on the device would reflect negatively on the tenant and threw away what remained of it five weeks ago after smashing it with a hammer.\n\nCano resigned last month after the state Judicial Standards Commission sought to suspend him, saying he was accused of letting three members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua live on his property in Las Cruces and have access to firearms.\"",
                "This sounds ridiculous.",
                "The narrative being presented in the article doesn't make a lot of sense to me.\n\nSo far as I'm aware there's nothing inherently illegal about shooting guns and alleged \"evidence tampering phone destruction\" seems very temporally disconnected from the other events.",
                "In a court filing, Cano denied the U.S. government\u2019s characterization of the men as gang members, saying each of them were subjected to \u201cthorough and rigorous\u201d proceedings with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents when they entered the country. He said the first time he heard that they may have gang ties was the morning federal agents raided their home took the men into custody.\n\nCano said he and his wife, Nancy Cano allowed the men to stay in their spare studio apartment in April 2024. He said they told the couple that they requested asylum upon entering the U.S. in 2023, were processed by immigration officials and were then released with court dates for their requests. Cano said the men showed paperwork to back up their stories.",
                "I dont understand how one can tamper with evidence if an investigation hasn't been formally announced or if the phone owner is not under indictment?\n\nHowever, basic legal principles doesn't seem to apply anymore when discussing the actions of these federal agencies. \n\nHowever, if he told investigators (why would he do so?) that he purposefully destroyed evidence pertaining to criminal conduct, that could be criminal misconduct I think or at the very least judicial misconduct. \n\nBut of course, being a judge and all, why would you even allow yourself to answer any questions about these people at all. Just keep your mouth shut or have a lawyer talk for you. \n\nAlso, the gun thing seems irrelevant. Unless these people are convicted felons, I dont think its illegal to give them access to firearms. Its kind of weird, but I suppose not illegal.   \n  \nI don't know, seems like a weird story but its interesting.",
                "Maybe its true but its probably not. They make fools of the public every day. You can\u2019t believe anything the trump and his doj puts out there. They\u2019ve routinely lied to federal judges under penalty of perjury. They will say anything at any time without regards to truth.",

She walked over to investigate around 10:30 p.m. but by then the protest had mostly disbursed. Not wanting to be filmed, she covered her face with a scarf.\n\n>\u201cAs soon as I pulled up my scarf, a group of 100 men came over immediately and encircled me,\u201d said the woman, who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity because she feared for her safety.\n\n>\u2018I had nowhere to go\u2019\n\n>\u201cThey were shouting at me, threatening to rape me, chanting \u2018death to Arabs.\u2019 I thought the police would protect me from the mob, but they did nothing to intervene,\u201d she said.\n\n>As the chants grew in intensity, a lone police officer tried to escort her to safety. They were followed for blocks by hundreds of men and boys jeering in Hebrew and English.\n\n>Video shows two of the men kicking her in the back, another hurling a traffic cone into her head and a fourth pushing a trash can into her.\n\n>\u201cThis is America,\u201d one of the men can be heard saying. \u201cWe got Israel. We got an Army now.\u201d\n\n>At one point, she and the police officer were nearly cornered against a building, the video shows.\n\n>\u201cI felt sheer terror,\u201d the woman recalled. \u201cI realized at that point that I couldn\u2019t lead this mob of men to my home. I had nowhere to go. I didn\u2019t know what to do. I was just terrified.\u201d"
