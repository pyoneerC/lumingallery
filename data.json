                ">\u201cSome will undoubtedly find today\u2019s decision unsatisfying, wondering why, if DOJ\u2019s ostensible reasons for dropping this case are so troubling, the Court does not simply deny the Motion to Dismiss altogether. But, as explained above, the Court cannot order DOJ to continue the prosecution, and it is aware of no authority (outside of the criminal contempt context) that would empower it, as some have urged, to appoint an independent prosecutor,\u201d Judge Ho wrote. \u201cTherefore, any decision by this Court to deny the Government\u2019s Motion to Dismiss would be futile at best, because DOJ could\u2014and, by all indications, unequivocally would\u2014simply refuse to prosecute the case, inevitably resulting in a dismissal after seventy days for violating the Mayor\u2019s right to a speedy trial. That route would simply postpone finality in this case to a date uncomfortably close to the June 24 mayoral primary. The public interest would not be served by such an outcome.\u201d\n\nSo basically the judge is saying, \u201cYes, the reasons DOJ wanted this dismissed are bad, but I can\u2019t force the prosecution to do their jobs, and if I dismiss with prejudice now they can\u2019t hold these charges over the head of an elected official to manipulate them.\u201d. These are the hard choices people have to make when the government has gone rogue and isn\u2019t interested in prosecuting someone who, by all accounts, very obviously took bribes from a foreign government.",

But, as explained above, the Court cannot order DOJ to continue the prosecution, and it is aware of no authority (outside of the criminal contempt context) that would empower it, as some have urged, to appoint an independent prosecutor,\u201d Judge Ho wrote. \u201cTherefore, any decision by this Court to deny the Government\u2019s Motion to Dismiss would be futile at best, because DOJ could\u2014and, by all indications, unequivocally would\u2014simply refuse to prosecute the case, inevitably resulting in a dismissal after seventy days for violating the Mayor\u2019s right to a speedy trial. That route would simply postpone finality in this case to a date uncomfortably close to the June 24 mayoral primary. The public interest would not be served by such an outcome.\u201d\n\nSo basically the judge is saying, \u201cYes, the reasons DOJ wanted this dismissed are bad, but I can\u2019t force the prosecution to do their jobs, and if I dismiss with prejudice now they can\u2019t hold these charges over the head of an elected official to manipulate them.\u201d.

But, as explained above, the Court cannot order DOJ to continue the prosecution, and it is aware of no authority (outside of the criminal contempt context) that would empower it, as some have urged, to appoint an independent prosecutor,\u201d Judge Ho wrote. \u201cTherefore, any decision by this Court to deny the Government\u2019s Motion to Dismiss would be futile at best, because DOJ could\u2014and, by all indications, unequivocally would\u2014simply refuse to prosecute the case, inevitably resulting in a dismissal after seventy days for violating the Mayor\u2019s right to a speedy trial. That route would simply postpone finality in this case to a date uncomfortably close to the June 24 mayoral primary. The public interest would not be served by such an outcome.\u201d\n\nSo basically the judge is saying, \u201cYes, the reasons DOJ wanted this dismissed are bad, but I can\u2019t force the prosecution to do their jobs, and if I dismiss with prejudice now they can\u2019t hold these charges over the head of an elected official to manipulate them.\u201d.

                "Good. Elon's money can't buy everything.\u00a0",
                "Hello from Wisconsin. Nearly $100M was poured into this race. It was fucking miserable for all of us. We should all be embarrassed that we have let this happen to our democracy.\n\nFuck oligarchs, fuck big money in politics.",
                "It just feels nice to read a positive headline for once. \n\nCongratulations to Susan, fuck you Elon.",
                "The thought of Elon coping and seething at this brings me great joy",
                "Well now trump is going to go extra nuclear tomorrow with whatever the plan was instead of firing elon for doing a piss poor job.",
                "And Elon spent millions on this race lmao",
                "Imagine being one of the richest people in human history and you still fail to use your unimaginable wealth to blatantly manipulate votes in a state election.\n\nIt's hard for me to think of anyone who has ever existed that is a bigger loser than Elon Musk."
