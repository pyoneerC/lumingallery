Counsel is aware of no provision in the death penalty statute or in the Department of Justice's death penalty protocol that allows for consideration of the social, economic or professional status of an alleged homicide victim in determining whether to seek the death penalty.\u201d**\n\nI encourage everyone to read the motion, it makes some strong points.",

Then they often send them home far too early (day of), and push all post surg follow up care back onto the family care provider because the surgeon discharged them and said they were good to go home and to talk to their family care provide. The patients aren\u2019t going to hop a flight back to Miami for care, so family med gets stuck with being cornered on taking out sutures and providing follow up care.
