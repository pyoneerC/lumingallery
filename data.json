                "I came across a tweet yesterday that was replying to someone about the near record breaking amount of tornado watches/warnings issued yesterday and it said:\n\n>Well you know ever since they announced that Trump was canceling leases on NWS buildings it seems like NWS pulled the lever and walked out the building letting the weather run wild. Yes I believe in weather modification.\n\nLike... man.. where would you even start with this claim?",

We had a a crackling thunderstorm here that kept me up half the night. Very unusual for 2 April. Scary stuff.",
                "Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m sure Trump will lob a few rolls of toilet paper at them and call it a day. THAT\u2019LL fix everything, right?",

I don't plan on buying a \\*new\\* car. I was thinking either off Marketplace with the help of a mechanic, or certified pre-owned. Do you think that the price of these cars will go up because of these tariffs? Even if it is private, possibly because of the increased demand to avoid tariffs?\n\nIn other words, should I say fuck it and buy a car sooner rather than later?"
