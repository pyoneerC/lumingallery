The program itself has nothing to do with racism.\n\nThe program is simply because 1 in 3 people there have intestinal parasitic hookworms, due to an extremely unsafe lack of proper sanitation.\n\nThe REASON this area has zero infrastructure for good sanitation is because the federal government and the state of Alabama have been extremely racist for 150 years, since black people were allowed to own land. The only place they were allowed to buy land was an area which was very low and had soil which made it basically impossible to dig sanitation infrastructure. \n\nOn top of that, due to segregationist zoning laws and redlining, their parents and grandparents were prohibited from buying land elsewhere. \n\nNow, they cannot move because the land they live on is basically worthless - nobody would want to buy their property for a reasonable price - and they cannot climb out of poverty due to suppressed wages and higher medical bills - due to the lack of sanitation.\n\nCan't sell the land, can't get better wages, can't climb out of poverty. \n\nThis is true for all the people there, regardless of race.\n\nSo, to repeat myself: the *current program* has nothing to do with DEI and race. Everyone who lives there benefits from it.\n\nThis is  also a perfect example of Critical Race Theory - it's not about anyone *currently* being racist. It's just that centuries of racism created this situation, and we need to fix it. \n\nDonald Trump, and Republicans, want to get rid of it because *they* are racist, though.",

Leonidas Varagiannis, a 21-year-old U.S. citizen, known as \"War\" was arrested in Greece, according to police. \n>\n>They allegedly led a core subgroup called 764 Inferno that operated using encrypted messaging platforms. Police say the men exploited at least eight minors, some as young as 13 years old.\n>\n>\"The information in the criminal complaint is sickening,\" said an online investigator named Becca who tracks 764 and shares what she learns with law enforcement. For her safety, we are only using her first name. \n>\n>...\n>\n>According to an affidavit and criminal complaint unsealed Wednesday in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, Nepal had been involved in 764 since its inception in 2020. He emerged as its leader in August 2021 after the founder, Bradley Cadenhead, was arrested by the FBI. \n>\n>Cadenhead created 764 in 2020 at the age of 15 and named the group after his area code in Stephenville, Texas. He is serving an 80-year sentence for pleading guilty to possession with intent to promote child pornography in 2023.\n>\n>Varagiannis is believed to have joined in December 2023 and became a co-leader of 764 Inferno, which was reserved solely for the inner core members of 764 and was by invitation only.\n>\n>Nepal and Varagiannis had strict rules for joining 764, according to police. Potential members had to produce and share content that often included child sexual abuse material and images of victims self harming.  \n>\n>\"These defendants are accused of orchestrating one of the most heinous online child exploitation enterprises we have ever encountered,\" said U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi in a media release Wednesday.\n>\n>Nepal and Varagiannis, along with two others, allegedly created a guide that gave prospective members instructions on how to create \"content\" by targeting vulnerable \"e-girls,\" who struggled with mental illness.\n>\n>...\n>\n>The group also poses an escalating threat worldwide as it forges alliances with other violent online groups that promote mass killings and targeted attacks. \n>\n>Other violent acts have been linked to 764, including a school shooting earlier this year in Nashville, stabbings last fall in Sweden and the murder of an elderly woman in Romania in 2022. \n>\n>Police have also foiled deadly plots tied to the groups in the U.K. and the United States in recent months. In Italy, police arrested a member last month who they say was in the advanced stages of a plan to kill vulnerable people.\n\nIf these allegations prove true, then these are some truly despicable acts perpetrated by some heinous people.",

It was never really necessary, but it made sense in that context. The idea that companies can use it to bring in lots of cheap crap to sell in the U.S. goes against the initial idea of the law, which was to exclude non-commercial imports from tariffs or other import duties. I don't think that these goods should be tariffed, but if you are selling something in the U.S., you should pay import duties.",
