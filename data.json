                "NPR last week interviewed a US attorney who is a US citizen, and he said the Trump administration is targeting US immigration attorneys. He was coming back from vacation and crossed the border checkpoint.That is when border patrol targeted him and detained him, then tried to confiscate his phone. They told him he was on a list for terrorists. He told them he had over ten years of attorney client privilege communications on his phone.  He told them absolutely not in confiscating his phone.  He said there are other immigration attorneys he personally knows that are also being harrassed by ICE and border patrol.\nhttps://www.npr.org/2025/04/09/nx-s1-5357455/attorney-detained-by-immigration-authorities",
