They said more information would be released as it becomes available.\n\nWitnesses on scene said about 45 police, fire and medical vehicles were on scene around 5:30 p.m. They saw city and state police enter the building with long rifles and K-9 units.\n\nPeople were being allowed to leave the mall in groups, a witness said.\n\nAn employee at Apple Cinemas Brass Mill said the shooting happened shortly before 4:40 p.m. They said they heard dozens of gunshots from the first floor of the mall in a matter of seconds, followed by screaming.\n\nFahd Syed's son was working inside the mall when the shooting occurred and he saw one of the injured victims on the floor screaming for help. Syed said his son couldn't help the woman \"because he didn't know if he was going to get shot himself.\"\n\nConnecticut State Police said troopers also responded to the incident, but directed any inquiries to the\u00a0Waterbury Police Department.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated as information becomes available.\n\nReporters Andreas Yilma and Bruno Matarazzo contributed to this story.",

                "A Vietnamese click farm is accused of duping Elon Musk\u2019s X out of a small fortune by exploiting apparently lax controls surrounding its \u201cCreator Revenue Sharing Program\u201d \u2013 an initiative touted by the world\u2019s richest person as a purported way for premium users to \u201cearn a living\u201d through their activity on the site.\n\nThe eight-man crew operated out of a dingy office space in downtown Hanoi, where they \u201cprogrammatically post[ed] computer-generated content\u201d to a network of \u201cinauthentic\u201d X profiles set up using stolen identities \u201cto engage in coordinated platform manipulation,\u201d according to a federal lawsuit filed Thursday and obtained by The Independent.\n\nIt says these automated profiles would subsequently \u201c\u2018like,\u2019 \u2018repost,\u2019 and otherwise artificially engage with each other\u2019s content, all for the purpose of deceiving X into paying out funds\u201d based on what the company \u2013 which just last year enthusiastically touted a new \u201cimproved authentic engagements algorithm\u201d \u2013 now claims were bogus clicks.\n\nThe \u201cfraudulent scheme,\u201d X\u2019s complaint contends, extracted payouts from the Creator Revenue Sharing Program \u201cby manufacturing the appearance of content engagement where none really exists.\u201d\n\nX is now seeking \u201cdisgorgement\u201d of the group\u2019s haul, suing them and 25 as-yet unidentified \u201cJohn Does\u201d for what its complaint calls \u201ca pattern of racketeering activity, including\u2026 thousands of predicate racketeering acts of wire fraud since at least 2023.\u201d\n\nAlthough the company\u2019s complaint does not specify the exact amount of the outfit\u2019s total take, it says the payments were funneled into at least 125 U.S. bank accounts, set up using stolen identities, and transferred to accounts in their real names at nine banks in Vietnam, across more than 1,700 individual transactions. The complaint was filed in Texas, where X is headquartered.\n\nAccording to the complaint, private investigators working for X eventually learned the names and addresses of the eight named defendants after external payment processing sites PingPong and Payoneer, where Stripe, X\u2019s payment processor, sent the Hanoi team\u2019s \u201cill-gotten gains,\u201d turned over the identity documents used to set up their accounts.\n\nThe five attorneys representing X in the case did not respond on Friday to requests for comment. Defendants Do Minh Thang, Phan Ngoc Tuan, Nguyen Ngoc Thanh, Le Dinh Chung, Nguyen Nhu Duc, Nguyen Viet Kieu, Do Viet Khanh, and Do Xuan Long were unable to be reached.\n\nX\u2019s revenue sharing program was launched in 2022, shortly after Musk bought the platform for $44 billion. In the beginning, premium users, who pay $8 a month for a blue \u201cverified\u201d checkmark next to their names and preferred algorithm placement, received a portion of the revenue generated by ads served to other premium users in their replies.\n\nBut when hate speech on X proliferated under Musk\u2019s stewardship, and major advertisers began to flee the site, the company rejiggered the program to instead reward accounts for how many interactions they generated with other premium users. Payouts vary based on a variety of factors, but one estimate pegs it at around $8 for every 1 million impressions.\n\n\u201cThe more engagement an account generates, the more the account holder is financially rewarded,\u201d X\u2019s complaint states.\n\nHowever, according to the complaint, the alleged fraudsters in Hanoi \u201cdeceive[d] X into concluding that the accounts they control are the accounts of legitimate content creators deserving of payment.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust as a broker in the financial industry may \u2018churn\u2019 profits by engaging in excessive and unnecessary trades in a client\u2019s investment account to generate artificially high commissions or fees, Defendants have employed software to create extensive, artificial engagement within a network of commonly-owned and controlled accounts,\u201d the complaint continues.\n\nThe group also sold their automation tools and techniques, generating a separate stream of income by teaching others how to help themselves to a slice of X\u2019s money, the complaint contends. One script, called the \u201cXGPT Tool,\u201d was advertised to tens of thousands of users on YouTube, TikTok, Telegram, Discord, Facebook, Instagram and X itself, the complaint goes on.\n\nOn top of the fraud allegations central to X\u2019s complaint, the filing also accuses the Hanoi hackers of trademark infringement, asserting they specifically \u201cmisuse[d] and misappropriate[d] the Twitter and X Trademarks\u201d in thumbnails for instructional videos posted to YouTube.\n\nBroadly speaking, X\u2019s complaint claims the alleged scam \u201chas harmed [its] reputation and customer relationships by introducing low-quality content to the platform.\u201d\n\nMusk has claimed he would ban engagement farming on X, but experts say paying for clicks only encourages it to continue.\n\n\u201cAnytime there\u2019s a monetary value added to clicks, there\u2019s going to be people going to the dark side,\u201d an Illinois social media marketing CEO told the Associated Press more than a decade ago.\n\nX is seeking \u201cinjunctive relief to disrupt the [Hanoi crew's] ongoing criminal scheme,\u201d and is asking for compensatory, treble, and punitive damages in an amount to be proven at trial.",

They said more information would be released as it becomes available.\n\nWitnesses on scene said about 45 police, fire and medical vehicles were on scene around 5:30 p.m. They saw city and state police enter the building with long rifles and K-9 units.\n\nPeople were being allowed to leave the mall in groups, a witness said.\n\nAn employee at Apple Cinemas Brass Mill said the shooting happened shortly before 4:40 p.m. They said they heard dozens of gunshots from the first floor of the mall in a matter of seconds, followed by screaming.\n\nFahd Syed's son was working inside the mall when the shooting occurred and he saw one of the injured victims on the floor screaming for help. Syed said his son couldn't help the woman \"because he didn't know if he was going to get shot himself.\"\n\nConnecticut State Police said troopers also responded to the incident, but directed any inquiries to the\u00a0Waterbury Police Department.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated as information becomes available.\n\nReporters Andreas Yilma and Bruno Matarazzo contributed to this story.",

                "A Vietnamese click farm is accused of duping Elon Musk\u2019s X out of a small fortune by exploiting apparently lax controls surrounding its \u201cCreator Revenue Sharing Program\u201d \u2013 an initiative touted by the world\u2019s richest person as a purported way for premium users to \u201cearn a living\u201d through their activity on the site.\n\nThe eight-man crew operated out of a dingy office space in downtown Hanoi, where they \u201cprogrammatically post[ed] computer-generated content\u201d to a network of \u201cinauthentic\u201d X profiles set up using stolen identities \u201cto engage in coordinated platform manipulation,\u201d according to a federal lawsuit filed Thursday and obtained by The Independent.\n\nIt says these automated profiles would subsequently \u201c\u2018like,\u2019 \u2018repost,\u2019 and otherwise artificially engage with each other\u2019s content, all for the purpose of deceiving X into paying out funds\u201d based on what the company \u2013 which just last year enthusiastically touted a new \u201cimproved authentic engagements algorithm\u201d \u2013 now claims were bogus clicks.\n\nThe \u201cfraudulent scheme,\u201d X\u2019s complaint contends, extracted payouts from the Creator Revenue Sharing Program \u201cby manufacturing the appearance of content engagement where none really exists.\u201d\n\nX is now seeking \u201cdisgorgement\u201d of the group\u2019s haul, suing them and 25 as-yet unidentified \u201cJohn Does\u201d for what its complaint calls \u201ca pattern of racketeering activity, including\u2026 thousands of predicate racketeering acts of wire fraud since at least 2023.\u201d\n\nAlthough the company\u2019s complaint does not specify the exact amount of the outfit\u2019s total take, it says the payments were funneled into at least 125 U.S. bank accounts, set up using stolen identities, and transferred to accounts in their real names at nine banks in Vietnam, across more than 1,700 individual transactions. The complaint was filed in Texas, where X is headquartered.\n\nAccording to the complaint, private investigators working for X eventually learned the names and addresses of the eight named defendants after external payment processing sites PingPong and Payoneer, where Stripe, X\u2019s payment processor, sent the Hanoi team\u2019s \u201cill-gotten gains,\u201d turned over the identity documents used to set up their accounts.\n\nThe five attorneys representing X in the case did not respond on Friday to requests for comment. Defendants Do Minh Thang, Phan Ngoc Tuan, Nguyen Ngoc Thanh, Le Dinh Chung, Nguyen Nhu Duc, Nguyen Viet Kieu, Do Viet Khanh, and Do Xuan Long were unable to be reached.\n\nX\u2019s revenue sharing program was launched in 2022, shortly after Musk bought the platform for $44 billion. In the beginning, premium users, who pay $8 a month for a blue \u201cverified\u201d checkmark next to their names and preferred algorithm placement, received a portion of the revenue generated by ads served to other premium users in their replies.\n\nBut when hate speech on X proliferated under Musk\u2019s stewardship, and major advertisers began to flee the site, the company rejiggered the program to instead reward accounts for how many interactions they generated with other premium users. Payouts vary based on a variety of factors, but one estimate pegs it at around $8 for every 1 million impressions.\n\n\u201cThe more engagement an account generates, the more the account holder is financially rewarded,\u201d X\u2019s complaint states.\n\nHowever, according to the complaint, the alleged fraudsters in Hanoi \u201cdeceive[d] X into concluding that the accounts they control are the accounts of legitimate content creators deserving of payment.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust as a broker in the financial industry may \u2018churn\u2019 profits by engaging in excessive and unnecessary trades in a client\u2019s investment account to generate artificially high commissions or fees, Defendants have employed software to create extensive, artificial engagement within a network of commonly-owned and controlled accounts,\u201d the complaint continues.\n\nThe group also sold their automation tools and techniques, generating a separate stream of income by teaching others how to help themselves to a slice of X\u2019s money, the complaint contends. One script, called the \u201cXGPT Tool,\u201d was advertised to tens of thousands of users on YouTube, TikTok, Telegram, Discord, Facebook, Instagram and X itself, the complaint goes on.\n\nOn top of the fraud allegations central to X\u2019s complaint, the filing also accuses the Hanoi hackers of trademark infringement, asserting they specifically \u201cmisuse[d] and misappropriate[d] the Twitter and X Trademarks\u201d in thumbnails for instructional videos posted to YouTube.\n\nBroadly speaking, X\u2019s complaint claims the alleged scam \u201chas harmed [its] reputation and customer relationships by introducing low-quality content to the platform.\u201d\n\nMusk has claimed he would ban engagement farming on X, but experts say paying for clicks only encourages it to continue.\n\n\u201cAnytime there\u2019s a monetary value added to clicks, there\u2019s going to be people going to the dark side,\u201d an Illinois social media marketing CEO told the Associated Press more than a decade ago.\n\nX is seeking \u201cinjunctive relief to disrupt the [Hanoi crew's] ongoing criminal scheme,\u201d and is asking for compensatory, treble, and punitive damages in an amount to be proven at trial.",

They said more information would be released as it becomes available.\n\nWitnesses on scene said about 45 police, fire and medical vehicles were on scene around 5:30 p.m. They saw city and state police enter the building with long rifles and K-9 units.\n\nPeople were being allowed to leave the mall in groups, a witness said.\n\nAn employee at Apple Cinemas Brass Mill said the shooting happened shortly before 4:40 p.m. They said they heard dozens of gunshots from the first floor of the mall in a matter of seconds, followed by screaming.\n\nFahd Syed's son was working inside the mall when the shooting occurred and he saw one of the injured victims on the floor screaming for help. Syed said his son couldn't help the woman \"because he didn't know if he was going to get shot himself.\"\n\nConnecticut State Police said troopers also responded to the incident, but directed any inquiries to the\u00a0Waterbury Police Department.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated as information becomes available.\n\nReporters Andreas Yilma and Bruno Matarazzo contributed to this story.",
