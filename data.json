                "I work in peds dentistry and trust me, parents are already saying no to fluoride and no to radiographs...and often they are spending thousands in treatments for composites, pulpotomies, etc. that could have been prevented. Dental health is overlooked so often in favor of extracirriculars. \"Sorry, Timmy has baseball practice so we need to reschedule/cancel.\" Ok, so Timmy is 7 years old, is a high caries risk, and hasn't seen us in 2 years. I think he can miss one fucking practice. People's priorities are alllll outta whack.\n\nWe get a lot of \"they won't let me brush their teeth!\" too. I'm sorry, who is the parent here? They're a small child, they need your guidance. I am empathetic to a point but you have to do it. If they didn't want to shit in the toilet, would you let them do it outside too? \n\nI fear we are going to get a lot busier. \ud83e\udd7a\n\nEDIT:\n\nWow ok, did not expect my comment to blow up. I just want to let yall know that I feel you on multiple fronts. I have a background in dental assisting, veterinary dentistry,  medical and dental research but now I work in the admin side of dentistry (not a dentist), so the financial issues and insurance issues I deal with on a daily basis are frustrating and heart breaking. It was the same when I worked in veterinary. As much as I wish we could do this fully subsidized, the USA hates universal health care and we have to make money to feed our staff. A lot of dentists, including my own, are eschewing being in network with a lot of insurances because they pay literal pennies for procedures. I'm talking about 15-20 bucks for full surgical procedures, which with how much dental school costs...it's not economical. I highly suggest to find a dentist that has a membership plan, it is often more cost effective than dental premiums!\n\nAs for health, if you truly don't want to give your kid flouride, there are alternatives that are NOT charcoal (seriously, don't! especially if theyre on meds!). Boka has nano hydroxyapatite toothpaste that has been clinically studied and is a great alternative. But I must insist you get radiographs, as the tooth is like an iceburg. A lot goes on underneath the surface. \n\nDentistry shouldn't be a luxury. I myself have talked to my local representatives about health care and dental care being my top concern and how we are doing nothing about it. My state, CA, can do better and I want it to be better. I wish I had all the solutions, I wish everyone here can get care. But please, do not yell at the staff if insurance isn't covering procedures. We literally can't control it. \ud83d\ude2d And I work with a dentist who would rather never see a cavity again. It is devastating to tell a parent their kid needs several crowns, pulpotomies, composites under anesthesia.",

The girl was like 17 and wanted to date guys in their mid 20s. This chick had everything. She had expensive clothes, cars, shoes...her parent were loaded. And, that was her response after 3 months to think about her mother dying of a heart attack outside of the church. \n\nYeah, i get it. Some people are wrongfully accused. But, many times over, murder (especially involving killing your parents or someone killing a child) they are typically 100% guilty (typically).

Did the dad even physical abuse either of these men when they were boys?  Or, was all this just a lie? Did they kill them because they felt entitled? \n\nI'm saying this to say that many times over the past 40 years, kids have murdered their parents, made up stories, only to be found out they were just overly spoiled brats. Only to be found out that they couldn't handle being told they couldn't have some car, or couldn't hang out with some friends.\n\nI knew a girl in the early 90s who's mom died at a church from a heart attack. Later on, maybe 3 months later, the girl told me she wasn't too hurt about her mother's death, because she wouldn't allow her to date older men. The girl was like 17 and wanted to date guys in their mid 20s. This chick had everything. She had expensive clothes, cars, shoes...her parent were loaded. And, that was her response after 3 months to think about her mother dying of a heart attack outside of the church. \n\nYeah, i get it. Some people are wrongfully accused. But, many times over, murder (especially involving killing your parents or someone killing a child) they are typically 100% guilty (typically). I just feel that those type of people do not deserve any second chances.

Did the dad even physical abuse either of these men when they were boys?  Or, was all this just a lie? Did they kill them because they felt entitled? \n\nI'm saying this to say that many times over the past 40 years, kids have murdered their parents, made up stories, only to be found out they were just overly spoiled brats. Only to be found out that they couldn't handle being told they couldn't have some car, or couldn't hang out with some friends.\n\nI knew a girl in the early 90s who's mom died at a church from a heart attack. Later on, maybe 3 months later, the girl told me she wasn't too hurt about her mother's death, because she wouldn't allow her to date older men. The girl was like 17 and wanted to date guys in their mid 20s. This chick had everything. She had expensive clothes, cars, shoes...her parent were loaded. And, that was her response after 3 months to think about her mother dying of a heart attack outside of the church. \n\nYeah, i get it. Some people are wrongfully accused. But, many times over, murder (especially involving killing your parents or someone killing a child) they are typically 100% guilty (typically). I just feel that those type of people do not deserve any second chances.

Dental health is overlooked so often in favor of extracirriculars. \"Sorry, Timmy has baseball practice so we need to reschedule/cancel.\" Ok, so Timmy is 7 years old, is a high caries risk, and hasn't seen us in 2 years. I think he can miss one fucking practice. People's priorities are alllll outta whack.\n\nWe get a lot of \"they won't let me brush their teeth!\" too. I'm sorry, who is the parent here? They're a small child, they need your guidance. I am empathetic to a point but you have to do it. If they didn't want to shit in the toilet, would you let them do it outside too? \n\nI fear we are going to get a lot busier. \ud83e\udd7a\n\nEDIT:\n\nWow ok, did not expect my comment to blow up. I just want to let yall know that I feel you on multiple fronts. I have a background in dental assisting, veterinary dentistry,  medical and dental research but now I work in the admin side of dentistry (not a dentist), so the financial issues and insurance issues I deal with on a daily basis are frustrating and heart breaking. It was the same when I worked in veterinary. As much as I wish we could do this fully subsidized, the USA hates universal health care and we have to make money to feed our staff. A lot of dentists, including my own, are eschewing being in network with a lot of insurances because they pay literal pennies for procedures. I'm talking about 15-20 bucks for full surgical procedures, which with how much dental school costs...it's not economical. I highly suggest to find a dentist that has a membership plan, it is often more cost effective than dental premiums!\n\nAs for health, if you truly don't want to give your kid flouride, there are alternatives that are NOT charcoal (seriously, don't! especially if theyre on meds!). Boka has nano hydroxyapatite toothpaste that has been clinically studied and is a great alternative. But I must insist you get radiographs, as the tooth is like an iceburg. A lot goes on underneath the surface. \n\nDentistry shouldn't be a luxury. I myself have talked to my local representatives about health care and dental care being my top concern and how we are doing nothing about it. My state, CA, can do better and I want it to be better. I wish I had all the solutions, I wish everyone here can get care. But please, do not yell at the staff if insurance isn't covering procedures. We literally can't control it. \ud83d\ude2d And I work with a dentist who would rather never see a cavity again. It is devastating to tell a parent their kid needs several crowns, pulpotomies, composites under anesthesia.",
