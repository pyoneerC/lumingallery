                "There are many, MANY issues with this. Off the top of my head:\n\n1. Sex crimes cases are often based off he-said-she-said. Which usually results in no convictions at all, unfortunately for the victims, but it also means that the convictions that DO happen CAN have no DNA evidence or solid scientific proof of guilt. Which is to say, there's a less than 100% chance that everyone convicted of a sex crime has actually committed a sex crime.\n2. Chemical castration is not generally designed to be permanent but rather sustained by regular exposure. But complications happen, permanent damage occurs, and lives can be ruined. When there's a less than 100% chance that every convicted sex criminal is in fact a criminal, a less than 100% reversal rate for the consequent punishment is insane.\n3. Chemical castration doesn't stop sex crimes. In fact, in many studies it's been proven to have the opposite effect. You know what's worse than a violent rapist/child rapist who committed these crimes in the first place? A sexually frustrated one with no outlet except more extreme violence.\n\nI for one LOVE the idea of child molesters and rapists losing their junk (though I like a more physical, un-anesthetized removal concept), but that doesn't change the fact that it's pure revenge fantasy and doesn't actually SOLVE a thing. This is a mistake.\n\nETA: While everyone is also completely correct to be concerned about the precedent, these things are almost never implemented on anything but a 'volunteer' basis. As in, the criminal has to opt-in to be chemically castrated vs staying in prison. It's meant to partially be proof of repentance and the desire to reform. It's shady and a bad call over all, but it's still the UK - they're PROBABLY (\ud83e\udd1e) not going to at any point in the modern day consider FORCING chemical castration on sex criminals."

                "There are many, MANY issues with this. Off the top of my head:\n\n1. Sex crimes cases are often based off he-said-she-said. Which usually results in no convictions at all, unfortunately for the victims, but it also means that the convictions that DO happen CAN have no DNA evidence or solid scientific proof of guilt. Which is to say, there's a less than 100% chance that everyone convicted of a sex crime has actually committed a sex crime.\n2. Chemical castration is not generally designed to be permanent but rather sustained by regular exposure. But complications happen, permanent damage occurs, and lives can be ruined. When there's a less than 100% chance that every convicted sex criminal is in fact a criminal, a less than 100% reversal rate for the consequent punishment is insane.\n3. Chemical castration doesn't stop sex crimes. In fact, in many studies it's been proven to have the opposite effect. You know what's worse than a violent rapist/child rapist who committed these crimes in the first place? A sexually frustrated one with no outlet except more extreme violence.\n\nI for one LOVE the idea of child molesters and rapists losing their junk (though I like a more physical, un-anesthetized removal concept), but that doesn't change the fact that it's pure revenge fantasy and doesn't actually SOLVE a thing. This is a mistake.\n\nETA: While everyone is also completely correct to be concerned about the precedent, these things are almost never implemented on anything but a 'volunteer' basis. As in, the criminal has to opt-in to be chemically castrated vs staying in prison. It's meant to partially be proof of repentance and the desire to reform. It's shady and a bad call over all, but it's still the UK - they're PROBABLY (\ud83e\udd1e) not going to at any point in the modern day consider FORCING chemical castration on sex criminals."

                "There are many, MANY issues with this. Off the top of my head:\n\n1. Sex crimes cases are often based off he-said-she-said. Which usually results in no convictions at all, unfortunately for the victims, but it also means that the convictions that DO happen CAN have no DNA evidence or solid scientific proof of guilt. Which is to say, there's a less than 100% chance that everyone convicted of a sex crime has actually committed a sex crime.\n2. Chemical castration is not generally designed to be permanent but rather sustained by regular exposure. But complications happen, permanent damage occurs, and lives can be ruined. When there's a less than 100% chance that every convicted sex criminal is in fact a criminal, a less than 100% reversal rate for the consequent punishment is insane.\n3. Chemical castration doesn't stop sex crimes. In fact, in many studies it's been proven to have the opposite effect. You know what's worse than a violent rapist/child rapist who committed these crimes in the first place? A sexually frustrated one with no outlet except more extreme violence.\n\nI for one LOVE the idea of child molesters and rapists losing their junk (though I like a more physical, un-anesthetized removal concept), but that doesn't change the fact that it's pure revenge fantasy and doesn't actually SOLVE a thing. This is a mistake.\n\nETA: While everyone is also completely correct to be concerned about the precedent, these things are almost never implemented on anything but a 'volunteer' basis. As in, the criminal has to opt-in to be chemically castrated vs staying in prison. It's meant to partially be proof of repentance and the desire to reform. It's shady and a bad call over all, but it's still the UK - they're PROBABLY (\ud83e\udd1e) not going to at any point in the modern day consider FORCING chemical castration on sex criminals."
