It was literally a guessing game whether the A/C would turn on when I got in the car. Persisted for about 3 months before a patch was rolled out.\n\n2.) The vaunted heat pump quit twice, once in winter (as we were moving across the country). Only a threat of litigation got the service center to replace the unit. Replacing it took the service center nearly a week.\n\n3.) A simple windshield replacement was needed after a rock caused a crack that started spreading. I scheduled service (soonest I could get a spot was 4 weeks out) which got delayed an additional whole month because \u201cOur glass guy is sick,\u201d and yet another whole month because \u201cWe don\u2019t have glass.\u201d\n\n4.) At 4 years of ownership, it was found that elements of the sub-frame were developing soon-to-be catastrophic cracks. No, I didn\u2019t rally race it.

You get those two together - and it's not always merely a supply surge issue - there is something in the underlying that there is no recovering from. \n\nGranted, it would be by far in Tesla's own interest to dump Musk, but the problem won't go away until Musk divests entirely.
