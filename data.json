                "&gt;For many women who develop bacterial vaginosis, the syndrome returns weeks or months after treatment. A clinical trial of women in monogamous relationships with male partners found that\u00a0[treating both partners significantly reduced the likelihood of recurrence](https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2405404), researchers report in the March 5\u00a0*New England Journal of Medicine*. When both partners were treated, 35 percent of the women developed bacterial vaginosis again, while in the women-only treatment group, it was 63 percent.\n\n&gt;The treatment approach builds on past research finding that sexual transmission may account for some repeat episodes of bacterial vaginosis. In the new trial, women received the standard treatment: either an oral antibiotic or an intravaginal antibiotic cream or gel. In the group in which both partners were treated, the male partner took the oral antibiotic and applied an antibiotic cream to the skin of the penis for seven days. In the women-only treatment group, 43 out of 68 developed bacterial vaginosis again within 12 weeks, while only 24 out of 69 did when both partners received treatment.\n\n[Read more here.](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment-women-men)",

                "&gt;For many women who develop bacterial vaginosis, the syndrome returns weeks or months after treatment. A clinical trial of women in monogamous relationships with male partners found that\u00a0[treating both partners significantly reduced the likelihood of recurrence](https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2405404), researchers report in the March 5\u00a0*New England Journal of Medicine*. When both partners were treated, 35 percent of the women developed bacterial vaginosis again, while in the women-only treatment group, it was 63 percent.\n\n&gt;The treatment approach builds on past research finding that sexual transmission may account for some repeat episodes of bacterial vaginosis. In the new trial, women received the standard treatment: either an oral antibiotic or an intravaginal antibiotic cream or gel. In the group in which both partners were treated, the male partner took the oral antibiotic and applied an antibiotic cream to the skin of the penis for seven days. In the women-only treatment group, 43 out of 68 developed bacterial vaginosis again within 12 weeks, while only 24 out of 69 did when both partners received treatment.\n\n[Read more here.](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment-women-men)",
