                "\"Former members of UK Special Forces have broken years of silence to give BBC Panorama eyewitness accounts of alleged war crimes committed by colleagues in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nGiving their accounts publicly for the first time, the veterans described seeing members of the SAS murder unarmed people in their sleep and execute handcuffed detainees, including children.\n\n\"They handcuffed a young boy and shot him,\" recalled one veteran who served with the SAS in Afghanistan.\u202f\"He was clearly a child, not even close to fighting age.\"\n\nKilling of detainees \"became routine\", the veteran said. \"They'd search someone, handcuff them, then shoot them\", before cutting off the plastic handcuffs used to restrain people and \"planting a pistol\" by the body, he said.\n\n...\n\nKnowledge of the alleged crimes was not confined to small teams or individual squadrons, according to the testimony. Within the UK Special Forces command structure, \"everyone knew\" what was happening, said one veteran.\n\n...\n\n\"There was a fake grenade they'd take with them onto target, it couldn't detonate,\" said a former SAS operator. Another veteran said operators would carry AK-47 rifles which had a folding stock because they were easier to fit into their rucksacks and \"easier to bring onto a target and plant by a body\".\n\nOfficers would then help to falsify post-operational reports in order to avoid scrutiny for the actions of assault teams on the ground, according to the testimony.\n\n...\n\n\"If it looked like a shooting could represent a breach of the rules of conflict, you'd get a phone call from the legal adviser or one of the staff officers in HQ. They'd pick you up on it and help you to clarify the language. 'Do you remember someone making a sudden move?' 'Oh yeah, I do now.' That sort of thing. It was built into the way we operated.\"\n\nThe reports were \"a fiction\", another UKSF veteran said.\n\nAn intelligence officer who worked with the SBS described reports which said they had been caught in a firefight, while the photos showed bodies with \"multiple clean headshots\".\n\n...\n\nThe Afghan president was \"so consistent with his complaints about night raids, civilian casualties and detentions that there was no senior Western diplomat or military leader who would have missed the fact that this was a major irritant for him,\" said Gen Douglas Lute, a former US ambassador to Nato.\n\n...\"",

Japan's third-biggest automaker is striving to make its business leaner and more resilient after weak sales in China and its biggest market the United States.\n\nNissan declined to comment on the report.\n\nIt is set to announce on Tuesday results for the business year that ended in March. It warned last month it would likely book a record 700 billion yen to 750 billion yen ($4.74 billion-$5.08 billion) net loss in that year due to impairment charges. The car maker missed out on the growing popularity of hybrid models in the United States and failed to capitalise on an early lead in electric vehicles there.\n\nIt has also suffered in China, the world's biggest auto market, where it plans to launch some 10 new vehicles in the coming years to try to halt a slide in sales. CEO Ivan Espinosa, who took over from Makoto Uchida as chief executive last month, is restructuring Nissan's operations and has previously said the company was considering extra measures. Nissan, which had more than 133,000 staff as of March last year, announced plans last November to cut 9,000 jobs and reduce global capacity by 20%.

In all, about 30 people were rescued.\n\n>Authorities have not said how the fire might have started.\n\n>Lipski said the building did not have a sprinkler system and was built in 1968, predating a law that would have required one, according to the fire chief.\n\n>\u201cIf we had sprinklers in the buidling we would have stopped the fire very, very small. We would not of had to have people jumping out of windows,\u201d he said.\n\n>Several other residents were treated for lesser injuries in the fire that began sometime before 8 a.m. The blaze rendered the 85-unit building uninhabitable, displacing an estimated 200 people.\n\n>James Rubinstein, a resident in the building, said he jumped to the ground floor.\n\n>\u201cThere was so much smoke. I climbed out the courtyard with my cat in my backpack,\u201d Rubinstein told television station FOX6 Milwaukee.\n\n>Emergency operaters received calls that people were trapped and jumping to escape. The first firefighters to arrive were \u201cfar, far outmatched\u201d by intense flames, Lipski said.\n\n>Authorities did not immediately release the identities or ages of the victims. Lipski said the fire began in a common area and spread to multiple floors.\n\n>Eddie Edwards, another resident of the building, said he also jumped to escape.\n\n>\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about nothing but getting away,\u201d he told Milwaukee television station WISN. \u201cGetting out and saving everyone\u2019s life.

                "Well shit, wish I saw this coming\u2026\n\n\u201cTOKYO, May 12 (Reuters) - Nissan Motor (7201.T) will cut more than 10,000 jobs globally, bringing the number of layoffs, including those previously announced, to about 20,000 or 15% of its workforce, Japan's public broadcaster NHK reported on Monday. Japan's third-biggest automaker is striving to make its business leaner and more resilient after weak sales in China and its biggest market the United States.\n\nNissan declined to comment on the report.\n\nIt is set to announce on Tuesday results for the business year that ended in March. It warned last month it would likely book a record 700 billion yen to 750 billion yen ($4.74 billion-$5.08 billion) net loss in that year due to impairment charges. The car maker missed out on the growing popularity of hybrid models in the United States and failed to capitalise on an early lead in electric vehicles there.\n\nIt has also suffered in China, the world's biggest auto market, where it plans to launch some 10 new vehicles in the coming years to try to halt a slide in sales. CEO Ivan Espinosa, who took over from Makoto Uchida as chief executive last month, is restructuring Nissan's operations and has previously said the company was considering extra measures. Nissan, which had more than 133,000 staff as of March last year, announced plans last November to cut 9,000 jobs and reduce global capacity by 20%. Advertisement \u00b7 Scroll to continue It has also said it would close a plant in Thailand by June and shut two more plants that it has not identified.\n\nOn Friday, it said it had decided to give up a plan to build a $1.1 billion factory, for which it was set to receive government subsidies, for EV batteries on Japan's southwestern island of Kyushu. Its weak performance forced it to cut its profit outlook four times for the financial year that just ended.\u201d",

Within the UK Special Forces command structure, \"everyone knew\" what was happening, said one veteran.\n\n...\n\n\"There was a fake grenade they'd take with them onto target, it couldn't detonate,\" said a former SAS operator. Another veteran said operators would carry AK-47 rifles which had a folding stock because they were easier to fit into their rucksacks and \"easier to bring onto a target and plant by a body\".\n\nOfficers would then help to falsify post-operational reports in order to avoid scrutiny for the actions of assault teams on the ground, according to the testimony.\n\n...\n\n\"If it looked like a shooting could represent a breach of the rules of conflict, you'd get a phone call from the legal adviser or one of the staff officers in HQ. They'd pick you up on it and help you to clarify the language. 'Do you remember someone making a sudden move?' 'Oh yeah, I do now.' That sort of thing. It was built into the way we operated.\"\n\nThe reports were \"a fiction\", another UKSF veteran said.\n\nAn intelligence officer who worked with the SBS described reports which said they had been caught in a firefight, while the photos showed bodies with \"multiple clean headshots\".\n\n...\n\nThe Afghan president was \"so consistent with his complaints about night raids, civilian casualties and detentions that there was no senior Western diplomat or military leader who would have missed the fact that this was a major irritant for him,\" said Gen Douglas Lute, a former US ambassador to Nato.\n\n...\"",

In all, about 30 people were rescued.\n\n>Authorities have not said how the fire might have started.\n\n>Lipski said the building did not have a sprinkler system and was built in 1968, predating a law that would have required one, according to the fire chief.\n\n>\u201cIf we had sprinklers in the buidling we would have stopped the fire very, very small. We would not of had to have people jumping out of windows,\u201d he said.\n\n>Several other residents were treated for lesser injuries in the fire that began sometime before 8 a.m. The blaze rendered the 85-unit building uninhabitable, displacing an estimated 200 people.\n\n>James Rubinstein, a resident in the building, said he jumped to the ground floor.\n\n>\u201cThere was so much smoke. I climbed out the courtyard with my cat in my backpack,\u201d Rubinstein told television station FOX6 Milwaukee.\n\n>Emergency operaters received calls that people were trapped and jumping to escape. The first firefighters to arrive were \u201cfar, far outmatched\u201d by intense flames, Lipski said.\n\n>Authorities did not immediately release the identities or ages of the victims. Lipski said the fire began in a common area and spread to multiple floors.\n\n>Eddie Edwards, another resident of the building, said he also jumped to escape.\n\n>\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about nothing but getting away,\u201d he told Milwaukee television station WISN. \u201cGetting out and saving everyone\u2019s life.

One of the five -- a 33-year-old man -- was experiencing a medical emergency, according to the Pinal County Sheriff's Office.\n\n>Civilians from within the hiking party attempted to initiate CPR, according to the Superstition Fire and Medical District, which serves Gold Canyon.\n\n>Rescue teams took over CPR efforts upon reaching the scene, but \"unfortunately the patient did not survive,\" SFMD said in a statement.\n\n>Temperatures in the area were close to 100 degrees on Sunday, and the medical emergency was linked to the heat.\n\n>\"No foul play is suspected,\" PCSO said. \"The Pinal County Medical Examiner will determine the cause of death.\"\n\n>\"Tragically this mountain rescue resulted in one fatality,\" SFDM said in a statement on Facebook, adding that the other four in the group were assisted down the mountain but \"refused transport to the hospital.\"\n\n>Officials encouraged people to avoid Wave Cave Trail for the remainder of the day on Sunday.\n\n>SFMD added an advisory to its social media post, saying that Arizona summers can reach upward of 110 F and \"heat exhaustion or heat stroke can occur in under an hour.\"\n\n>\"Most heat deaths happen on trails between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., the hottest part of the day,\" the post continued.\n\n>\"If you feel dizzy, nauseous, stop sweating, or become confused, get help immediately,\" SFMD added. \"Please stay safe and plan wisely.
