Some of these hospitalized children will need to be put on a ventilator to recover, Stinchfield said.\nIn about 1 in 1,000 cases, measles causes brain swelling, or encephalitis, which can cause seizures. When it's not fatal, the swelling itself can subside, but it can cause permanent brain damage and other lasting side effects, such as blindness or deafness. \nThe measles virus is capable of replicating in the brain, said Ross Kedl, a professor of immunology at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. In some cases, the immune system beats the virus back and the person seems to recover, but measles still lurks in their nervous system.\n\n> The nightmarish effect of this long-term persistence is a condition called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). This is a progressive neurological disorder that might start with mood changes and muscle tremors; then, as it progresses, the person starts losing speech, vision and hearing. After about two years, the person falls into a coma and dies. \n\n\nIt can also erase antibodies that their bodies have created to fight other diseases. It's absolutely insane to me people are willing to risk their own children and other immunocompromised people like this.",

Some of these hospitalized children will need to be put on a ventilator to recover, Stinchfield said.\nIn about 1 in 1,000 cases, measles causes brain swelling, or encephalitis, which can cause seizures. When it's not fatal, the swelling itself can subside, but it can cause permanent brain damage and other lasting side effects, such as blindness or deafness. \nThe measles virus is capable of replicating in the brain, said Ross Kedl, a professor of immunology at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. In some cases, the immune system beats the virus back and the person seems to recover, but measles still lurks in their nervous system.\n\n> The nightmarish effect of this long-term persistence is a condition called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). This is a progressive neurological disorder that might start with mood changes and muscle tremors; then, as it progresses, the person starts losing speech, vision and hearing. After about two years, the person falls into a coma and dies. \n\n\nIt can also erase antibodies that their bodies have created to fight other diseases.
