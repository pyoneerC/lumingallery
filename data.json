Thus tens of millions of people get different I information, news, facts, truths, etc than tens of millions of others. \n\nThat is the ONLY way you achieve what this nation has in the past decade. \n\nThirty years ago, Trump would have been laughed out of the 2015 primaries. \n\nBut after 30+ years (starting in the 1990s) of partisan based escalating Culture War for profit, by the time the \u201cage of information\u201d took hold half the country was just ready and waiting for an anti-lib media ecosystem. \n\nThey had Rush and Fox News and in the days before the World Wide Web was truly ubiquitous that was more than enough to make billions off culture war. But it wasn\u2019t enough to truly alter/diverge realities. The way information traveled was still \u201cslow\u201d. Outlets, regardless of lean were all still covering the same basic news stories. Average Americans may have had bias one way or the other, but they still all got more or less the same basic information from which to understand the world. \n\nBut that stopped being true once the flood gates of digital media opened, and they technology of targeted advertising became the number one business model in the digital age. \n\nThe barrier of entry was lowered so much that millions could start a blog, a community, or a \u201cnew media\u201d company. Better yet, there are nearly no rules to how you create and spread information online. Your voice, for free, can carry equal weight to a press outlet that has to pay researchers, editors, reporters, fact checkers, and journalists. Your voice can EARN as much as outlets that  have basic news gathering and reporting standards and practices. \n\nThere was never a version of this world where real news gathering/reporting and real journalism were ever going to survive in the face of millions of people who can just blast their opinions and hot takes. Especially when ad sales platforms do not care what those opinions and hot takes are. Especially when millions of people don\u2019t care if what they say is accurate, true, or even in good faith. \n\nAnd all of the above is BEFORE social media, with its engagement and personalization algos, and it\u2019s built in incentives to create and spread as much content as possible. \n\nWE\n\nARE\n\nBROKEN",

The union is arguing that they need to be consulted and negotiated with no matter what the change is.\n\n\nThey are not dying on the hill of the dress code.

The union is arguing that they need to be consulted and negotiated with no matter what the change is.\n\n\nThey are not dying on the hill of the dress code.

The union is arguing that they need to be consulted and negotiated with no matter what the change is.\n\n\nThey are not dying on the hill of the dress code.

The victim said shortly after she was pulled out of school, she was \u201cforced to live in a dog crate for approximately one year and was let out periodically,\u201d the release said.\u00a0\n\n>Later, she was forced to live in a padlocked bathroom and was chained up. She told police she would be let out of the bathroom when family visited the home. At other times she lived in a bare room with a bucket to use as a toilet.\n\n>The victim told police the room had an alarm system that would \u201calert Spencer and Mosley if she tried to leave.\u201d The victim also reported being beaten with a belt and sexually abused by Mosley, officials stated.\n\nIt's a horrific story, with more details including a 13-year-old who also lived there as well as the kids being pulled out of school years before. How this couple (assuming they are parents but it doesn't specifically say so) could do that do another human being is unfathomable.
