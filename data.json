Thats the HARD part that needs a lot of infrastructure, power and skill.\n\nThere is a new one under construction in California. Its a $1.8Bln facility, owned by an Australian company. Otherwise the ore has to be export to Australia, Chile or China. The US does have some other processing capabilities, but its mostly the Aussies with the know-how (I guess it involves using shitty beer to do it? j/k). \n\nBear in mind that if its processed abroad thats 2 x shipping costs, plus hazards materials handling, plus a tariff.\n\nSo that $1.8Bln plant, even if its a smaller facility, will be really useful! But its not going to be able to handle all of it, or in a timely manner.\n\nThis is a good link for more info: [Lithium Supply Chain: Understanding the Basics | Shipping and Commodity Academy](https://shippingandcommodityacademy.com/blog/lithium-supply-chain-understanding-the-basics/) (other pages exist but they all say about the same thing.

(There's a summer camp there that predates the smokestacks that kids roll around in the dirt right THERE.) \n\nIn Butte, Montana and subsequently a 200 mile radius and anywhere in the MT/WY/NV area there are both smokestack areas of contamination and pools of deadly chemicals leftover from the 1800s-1970s. Pools of arsenic and lead. If you've been there you know.  Cows and horses just walk around grazing in these areas.\n\nPicher, Oklahoma - \"the most toxic ghost town\" in the USA.

(source - Geologist who works for oil company who quit over it I dated - so dubious.) \n\nQuestion is not \"We make money now\"\n\nbut \"Where will we live AFTER the mine closes and we don't make money anymore?\"\n\nExample of Lithium Extract- from source:\n\n# Brine Extraction\n\nBrine extraction is another method of extracting lithium. This method involves pumping brine from underground aquifers into evaporation ponds. The sun and wind evaporate the water, leaving behind lithium and other minerals. The following are the steps involved in brine extraction:\n\n* Drilling: Wells are drilled into the ground to access the brine.\n* Pumping: The brine is pumped to the surface and transported to the evaporation ponds.\n* Evaporation: The brine is evaporated in the ponds, leaving behind lithium and other minerals.\n* Processing: The extracted lithium is then processed to produce lithium carbonate or other lithium compounds.\n\nBrine extraction is a less costly and less energy-intensive method of extracting lithium. It is also less harmful to the environment than hard rock mining. However, it is highly dependent on weather conditions, and the process can take several months to complete.\n\nOverall, both hard rock mining and brine extraction have their advantages and disadvantages. Companies choose the method that suits their needs and resources.\n\n#",

His detention began in March 2025, despite the U.S. government later dropping one of the charges against him. \n\nDoroudi's student visa was revoked in June 2023 without explanation.  At that time, the university advised him that he could legally remain in the U.S. as long as he maintained his student status and did not leave the country.  In the spring of 2025, the government filed two charges to justify his deportation: the revoked visa and his alleged failure to maintain student status.  The first charge was withdrawn after the government acknowledged that the visa revocation was \"prudential\" and not immediately effective.  His attorney, David Rozas, is contesting the second charge. \n\nDespite having no criminal record or involvement in political activism, Doroudi was denied bond and held in a Louisiana detention facility.  Frustrated by the prolonged detention and the impact on his life, he chose to self-deport.  His fianc\u00e9e, Sama Ebrahimi Bajgani, and his attorney expressed deep sadness and questioned why he was targeted.

His detention began in March 2025, despite the U.S. government later dropping one of the charges against him. \n\nDoroudi's student visa was revoked in June 2023 without explanation.  At that time, the university advised him that he could legally remain in the U.S. as long as he maintained his student status and did not leave the country.  In the spring of 2025, the government filed two charges to justify his deportation: the revoked visa and his alleged failure to maintain student status.  The first charge was withdrawn after the government acknowledged that the visa revocation was \"prudential\" and not immediately effective.  His attorney, David Rozas, is contesting the second charge. \n\nDespite having no criminal record or involvement in political activism, Doroudi was denied bond and held in a Louisiana detention facility.  Frustrated by the prolonged detention and the impact on his life, he chose to self-deport.  His fianc\u00e9e, Sama Ebrahimi Bajgani, and his attorney expressed deep sadness and questioned why he was targeted.

Thats the HARD part that needs a lot of infrastructure, power and skill.\n\nThere is a new one under construction in California. Its a $1.8Bln facility, owned by an Australian company. Otherwise the ore has to be export to Australia, Chile or China. The US does have some other processing capabilities, but its mostly the Aussies with the know-how (I guess it involves using shitty beer to do it? j/k). \n\nBear in mind that if its processed abroad thats 2 x shipping costs, plus hazards materials handling, plus a tariff.\n\nSo that $1.8Bln plant, even if its a smaller facility, will be really useful! But its not going to be able to handle all of it, or in a timely manner.\n\nThis is a good link for more info: [Lithium Supply Chain: Understanding the Basics | Shipping and Commodity Academy](https://shippingandcommodityacademy.com/blog/lithium-supply-chain-understanding-the-basics/) (other pages exist but they all say about the same thing.

(There's a summer camp there that predates the smokestacks that kids roll around in the dirt right THERE.) \n\nIn Butte, Montana and subsequently a 200 mile radius and anywhere in the MT/WY/NV area there are both smokestack areas of contamination and pools of deadly chemicals leftover from the 1800s-1970s. Pools of arsenic and lead. If you've been there you know.  Cows and horses just walk around grazing in these areas.\n\nPicher, Oklahoma - \"the most toxic ghost town\" in the USA.

(source - Geologist who works for oil company who quit over it I dated - so dubious.) \n\nQuestion is not \"We make money now\"\n\nbut \"Where will we live AFTER the mine closes and we don't make money anymore?\"\n\nExample of Lithium Extract- from source:\n\n# Brine Extraction\n\nBrine extraction is another method of extracting lithium. This method involves pumping brine from underground aquifers into evaporation ponds. The sun and wind evaporate the water, leaving behind lithium and other minerals. The following are the steps involved in brine extraction:\n\n* Drilling: Wells are drilled into the ground to access the brine.\n* Pumping: The brine is pumped to the surface and transported to the evaporation ponds.\n* Evaporation: The brine is evaporated in the ponds, leaving behind lithium and other minerals.\n* Processing: The extracted lithium is then processed to produce lithium carbonate or other lithium compounds.\n\nBrine extraction is a less costly and less energy-intensive method of extracting lithium. It is also less harmful to the environment than hard rock mining. However, it is highly dependent on weather conditions, and the process can take several months to complete.\n\nOverall, both hard rock mining and brine extraction have their advantages and disadvantages. Companies choose the method that suits their needs and resources.\n\n#",

His detention began in March 2025, despite the U.S. government later dropping one of the charges against him. \n\nDoroudi's student visa was revoked in June 2023 without explanation.  At that time, the university advised him that he could legally remain in the U.S. as long as he maintained his student status and did not leave the country.  In the spring of 2025, the government filed two charges to justify his deportation: the revoked visa and his alleged failure to maintain student status.  The first charge was withdrawn after the government acknowledged that the visa revocation was \"prudential\" and not immediately effective.  His attorney, David Rozas, is contesting the second charge. \n\nDespite having no criminal record or involvement in political activism, Doroudi was denied bond and held in a Louisiana detention facility.  Frustrated by the prolonged detention and the impact on his life, he chose to self-deport.  His fianc\u00e9e, Sama Ebrahimi Bajgani, and his attorney expressed deep sadness and questioned why he was targeted.

Thats the HARD part that needs a lot of infrastructure, power and skill.\n\nThere is a new one under construction in California. Its a $1.8Bln facility, owned by an Australian company. Otherwise the ore has to be export to Australia, Chile or China. The US does have some other processing capabilities, but its mostly the Aussies with the know-how (I guess it involves using shitty beer to do it? j/k). \n\nBear in mind that if its processed abroad thats 2 x shipping costs, plus hazards materials handling, plus a tariff.\n\nSo that $1.8Bln plant, even if its a smaller facility, will be really useful! But its not going to be able to handle all of it, or in a timely manner.\n\nThis is a good link for more info: [Lithium Supply Chain: Understanding the Basics | Shipping and Commodity Academy](https://shippingandcommodityacademy.com/blog/lithium-supply-chain-understanding-the-basics/) (other pages exist but they all say about the same thing. Obviously the \"US reserves\" are now slightly higher than on that page mind).",

(There's a summer camp there that predates the smokestacks that kids roll around in the dirt right THERE.) \n\nIn Butte, Montana and subsequently a 200 mile radius and anywhere in the MT/WY/NV area there are both smokestack areas of contamination and pools of deadly chemicals leftover from the 1800s-1970s. Pools of arsenic and lead. If you've been there you know.  Cows and horses just walk around grazing in these areas.\n\nPicher, Oklahoma - \"the most toxic ghost town\" in the USA. The entire story is a trip. Silent Hill type stuff. I went to a museum exhibit on it in Norman.\n\nEdmond, OK - currently having to treat it's watershed contaminated with fracking juices - oh but they won't tell you that.  They just want to see you bougie houses and ride out the earthquakes.  (source - Geologist who works for oil company who quit over it I dated - so dubious.) \n\nQuestion is not \"We make money now\"\n\nbut \"Where will we live AFTER the mine closes and we don't make money anymore?\"\n\nExample of Lithium Extract- from source:\n\n# Brine Extraction\n\nBrine extraction is another method of extracting lithium. This method involves pumping brine from underground aquifers into evaporation ponds. The sun and wind evaporate the water, leaving behind lithium and other minerals. The following are the steps involved in brine extraction:\n\n* Drilling: Wells are drilled into the ground to access the brine.\n* Pumping: The brine is pumped to the surface and transported to the evaporation ponds.\n* Evaporation: The brine is evaporated in the ponds, leaving behind lithium and other minerals.\n* Processing: The extracted lithium is then processed to produce lithium carbonate or other lithium compounds.\n\nBrine extraction is a less costly and less energy-intensive method of extracting lithium. It is also less harmful to the environment than hard rock mining. However, it is highly dependent on weather conditions, and the process can take several months to complete.\n\nOverall, both hard rock mining and brine extraction have their advantages and disadvantages. Companies choose the method that suits their needs and resources.\n\n#",
