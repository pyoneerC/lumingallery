There was no real \"winning\" solution they could market because they kept changing the fundamentals and principles of the program. Yes, it centered around points, but they constantly changed the \"rules\" of the program with no real evidence to back up why.

                "So a man went into the women\u2019s room and tried to find out what someone using that women\u2019s rooms genitals look like? \n\nIsn\u2019t that the whole thing these people are supposedly mad about? The thing they supposedly want to prevent is actually happening because they\u2019re so scared of a trans woman potentially being in the stall next to them?",
                "An actual man walked into the women\u2019s bathroom and harassed a woman. This is why these conservatives gross me out- I\u2019ve never been harassed by a transgender person but I\u2019ve been plenty harassed by men.",
                "> Ansley Baker and her girlfriend, Liz Victor, went to a Kentucky Derby party at the hotel Saturday. The couple, who are both cis women, said their afternoon ended when hotel security searched the women's restroom and allegedly asked them to show their identification to prove their sex. \n\nRemembering how terfs talked about protecting lesbians and end up creating environment where they\u2019re harassed\n\n> Nina Selvaggio, the Executive Director of the Greater Boston PFLAG, said this incident is the result of ramped up rhetoric at the national level. Selvaggio pointed to a statistic that showed Massachusetts hate crimes have hit a 20-year high.  \n\n>\"For gender nonconforming, lesbians, women in general, being harassed in public restrooms is a tale as old as time. I do think the surge in national anti-trans rhetoric is contributing to an increased policing of women's bodies and their expression of gender,\" Selvaggio said.",

It\u2019s not like a locker room, right? Even if a straight male walked in there (by mistake) they wouldn\u2019t see anything, right? The whole thing is stupid. I have seen many of a women use the men\u2019s room when the lady\u2019s line was to long, nobody gave a shit.",
                "Will TERFs like JK Rowling tweet all day about the injustice done to this woman? That not only did a guard harass her, but also other women in the bathroom said \u201che [sic] is a creep get him out\u201d! Will she say they failed to be true allies? I suspect no TERFs will give a shit when they see the woman\u2019s picture because they don\u2019t care about women\u2019s rights - they are about the correct women\u2019s (eg their own) rights and mostly the right to have society conform to them.\n\nHappy to be corrected if any TERFs stand up"

We paddled past him roughly 150 ft up the trail as he got out onto a slide, and he luckily must have eaten recently because he paid us no mind despite us being a few mere feet away from him. But in the back of my head for the whole trip all I could think of is how easily he vanished and how there could be anything below us at any given moment. At his size he very easily could have capsized our canoe if he really wanted to. Extremely unfortunate for this couple.",

We paddled past him roughly 150 ft up the trail as he got out onto a slide, and he luckily must have eaten recently because he paid us no mind despite us being a few mere feet away from him.
