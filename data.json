Four of the men allegedly filmed the scenes of them sexually assaulting their biological or foster daughters, aged between 6 and 14 at the time, and shared the footage within a social media group, while the other three owned obscene images of underage individuals.\n\nIn the messaging app used by the group, there were comments reading, \"I've trained her since she was 3,\" \"Just telling her, 'If you tell your mom, you wouldn't be able to be with your dad. Can you keep a secret?' worked for me,\" and, \"Because my wife is away on a trip.\" The prefectural police believe that the men continued to sexually abuse their own daughters and others on a regular basis.\n\nIn November last year, one of the men was arrested on suspicion of penetrative sexual assault of an underage person, and a probe of his mobile phone revealed that the group was sharing obscene videos.\n\nIt is thought that the group, comprised of men fond of incest with minors, started exchanging information in around December 2023.

Also, Canada must immediately drop their Anti-American Farmer Tariff of 250% to 390% on various U.S. dairy products, which has long been considered outrageous. I will shortly be declaring a National Emergency on Electricity within the threatened area. This will allow the U.S to quickly do what has to be done to alleviate this abusive threat from Canada. If other egregious, long time Tariffs are not likewise dropped by Canada, I will substantially increase, on April 2nd, the Tariffs on Cars coming into the U.S. which will, essentially, permanently shut down the automobile manufacturing business in Canada. Those cars can easily be made in the USA! Also, Canada pays very little for National Security, relying on the United States for military protection. We are subsidizing Canada to the tune of more than 200 Billion Dollars a year. WHY??? This cannot continue. The only thing that makes sense is for Canada to become our cherished Fifty First State. This would make all Tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear. Canadians taxes will be very substantially reduced, they will be more secure, militarily and otherwise, than ever before, there would no longer be a Northern Border problem, and the greatest and most powerful nation in the World will be bigger, better and stronger than ever \u2014 And Canada will be a big part of that.

                "Why was the kid in a hyperbaric chamber??",
                "Four people have been arrested after a 5-year-old boy was killed in a hyperbaric chamber explosion in Troy, Michigan.\n\nThe Troy Police Department confirmed that the arrests occurred Monday morning. They are scheduled to be arraigned on Tuesday.\n\nPolice did not release the names of the people arrested; however, court records show that one of them was Tami Peterson, the center's owner. \n\nCBS News Detroit reached out to the Oxford Center for comment and received the following statement: \n\n    \"After cooperating with multiple investigations starting immediately after the tragic accident in January, we are disappointed to see charges filed.\n\n    \"The timing of these charges is surprising, as the typical protocol after a fire-related accident has not yet been completed. There are still outstanding questions about how this occurred. Yet, the Attorney General's office proceeded to pursue charges without those answers.\n\n    \"Our highest priority every day is the safety and wellbeing of the children and families we serve, which continues during this process.\"\n\nInvestigators say Thomas Cooper was in the chamber when it exploded on Jan. 31, 2025. The boy's mother was in the room at the time and was injured in the explosion. In a news conference shortly after the incident, Troy police and fire departments did not indicate what may have led to the explosion but said that hyperbaric chambers are filled with 100% oxygen and are, therefore, combustible devices.\n\nWithin days of the tragedy, the family retained Fieger Law, which alleges that the center had a history of being involved in questionable business practices.\n\nAttorney James Harrington told CBS News Detroit last month that his office was getting ready to file a lawsuit demanding answers into what led to his death. Harrington said the lawsuit will be filed pending their investigation.\n\n\"Under no circumstances ... should anything ever like this happen and the only way this happens is negligence,\" Harrington said. \"This industry in Michigan is unregulated. There's not a lot of science to back these claims that are being made as to what ailments and problems can actually be fixed or better by this hyperbaric treatment.\"",
                "Charges are second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter according to this article:\n\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/4-charged-death-michigan-boy-killed-hyperbaric-chamber-fire-rcna195753",

                "They were trying to \"cure\" his ND disorders (ADHD and I think something else).\u00a0\n\n\nIt's rich that their attorney is saying there's no science behind this and it should be better regulated.\n\n\nNo. It should be banned outright. And also, I don't think the parents are blameless. Take your kid to a fucking doctor. I know these places are predatory but take your kid to a fucking doctor.\u00a0\n\n\nMy kid has ADHD and is the same age as this kid, and we live not too far from there. Breaks my heart.\u00a0",

Four of the men allegedly filmed the scenes of them sexually assaulting their biological or foster daughters, aged between 6 and 14 at the time, and shared the footage within a social media group, while the other three owned obscene images of underage individuals.\n\nIn the messaging app used by the group, there were comments reading, \"I've trained her since she was 3,\" \"Just telling her, 'If you tell your mom, you wouldn't be able to be with your dad. Can you keep a secret?' worked for me,\" and, \"Because my wife is away on a trip.\" The prefectural police believe that the men continued to sexually abuse their own daughters and others on a regular basis.\n\nIn November last year, one of the men was arrested on suspicion of penetrative sexual assault of an underage person, and a probe of his mobile phone revealed that the group was sharing obscene videos.\n\nIt is thought that the group, comprised of men fond of incest with minors, started exchanging information in around December 2023.

It came after days of chaotic protests at that location following the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer; Bowser had clashed with Trump over her handling of the protests.\n\n>But now Bowser has little power to fend off encroachments on D.C.\u2019s limited autonomy. Bowser said last week on X that, \u201cThe mural inspired millions of people and helped our city through a painful period, but now we can\u2019t afford to be distracted by meaningless congressional interference. The devastating impacts of the federal job cuts must be our number one concern.\u201d\n\n>Among those who gathered to witness the work Monday was Megan Bailiff, CEO of Equus Striping, the pavement marking company that originally painted the letters. Bailiff called the dismantling of Black Lives Matter Plaza, \u201chistorically obscene\u201d and said its presence was, \u201cmore significant at this very moment than it ever has been in this country.\u201d \n\n>The far right celebrated the shift online, with conservative provocateur Charlie Kirk visiting the site to hail, \u201cthe end of this mass race hysteria in our country.\u201d \n\n>In Trump\u2019s second term, Bowser has worked to avoid conflict and downplay any points of contention. She traveled to Mar-a-Lago in Florida to meet with Trump after the election and has publicly emphasized their points of agreement.\n\n>Trump recently revived a frequent campaign talking point about wanting a federal \u201ctakeover\u201d of the nation\u2019s capital, describing Washington as being riddled with crime, graffiti and homeless encampments. Bowser has refused to comment on reports that the White House is preparing an executive order targeting Washington. She publicly said that the greatest threat to the so-called Home Rule autonomy was \u201csome of the people in Congress.\u201d\n\n>Congressional Republicans have repeatedly threatened to interfere in city affairs in large and small ways. A measure currently before Congress, named the BOWSER Act, seeks to completely revoke the Home Rule Act of 1973, which grants the capital city limited autonomy.",

Can you keep a secret?' worked for me,\" and, \"Because my wife is away on a trip.\" The prefectural police believe that the men continued to sexually abuse their own daughters and others on a regular basis.\n\nIn November last year, one of the men was arrested on suspicion of penetrative sexual assault of an underage person, and a probe of his mobile phone revealed that the group was sharing obscene videos.\n\nIt is thought that the group, comprised of men fond of incest with minors, started exchanging information in around December 2023.
