The Tower then cleared the other aircraft to take off on that runway, not realizing United missed the turn and was still on the runway.  \n\nThe simple solution is that Tower should always control the runway.

There's no industrial safety record in any industry that even approaches it. There's a few things about light water reactors that actually make them safer, though not as uranium efficient as their larger counterparts, much like how a campfire is much safer and easier to manage than a bonfire, you're just heating a smaller space.\u00a0\n\n\nAbout the only thing the NRC is built to handle regulation wise is a light water reactor.
