Freedom of association, the right to due process, the right to bear arms, and private property rights should not be infringed upon by the government. \n\nNot even against people we disagree with. \n\nAnd not even by politicians we agree with. \n\nTo permit otherwise opens the door to selective applications of law. If the law can be selective, then deportations for speech elected officials dislike, for suspected gang affiliation, for opposing government actions are all just as legitimate. \n\nThat's what rule of law means. The law has to apply to everyone equally and there are limits to what elected officials can impose on the public.\n\nNot that the current Republican government is actually following that principle. The Supreme Court only declined to hear the case because the lower court ruling aligns with the Republican platform *for now*.",
