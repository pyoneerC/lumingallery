Beginning on March 28th, users of Echo smart speakers and Echo Show displays won't be able to block their devices from sending all voice recordings to Amazon for analysis.\n\n\nKeeping voice recordings local is an important privacy feature for any voice assistant, and removing it raises serious questions about what Amazon is listening to. And even if you didn't know about these privacy settings before, I bet you're worried about voice assistant privacy in general: Our CNET Survey found over 70% of people have privacy concerns about adding more AI to home voice assistants -- and now we're seeing those fears in action.\"",

                "When I was in 8th grade I stumbled on a book that depicted actual sexual relationships between high-school age teenagers in the library at school - nothing actually pornagraphic, it just discussed teenage sexuality as it was. There was an instance at a camp, another at a party, I forget. I've actually tried finding the book as an adult and I've never been able to. It had won an award even but that never helped me.\n\nThis book also had characters that were questioning their sexuality, in a very adolescent ways and exploratory sense - all of this wasn't the story itself, much like in real life, diacovering sexuality is just one of the things that happens during adolescence and high-school. \n\nIn 8th grade I was just beginning to notice how much I noticed the other the other boys and how little I noticed the girls...\n\nThat book was the first book I had ever read that presented my experience alongside the \"normal experience\" as if it was the same. It was one of the only examples in my childhood of a gay high-schooler. He was dealing with some of same shit I was - I think my experience, especially where I grew up, would have been harder had I not read that book. It reassured me that I was normal, just uncommon.\n\nThese parents believe their protecting their children from the evils of the world. That book didn't make me gay tho, I was always gay. Teenagers don't need sexually explicit content to be sexual - evolution will take care of that all on its own. Helping the kids understand all of this is better for them than pretending none of this is real.",
