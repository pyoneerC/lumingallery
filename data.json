                "I work in peds dentistry and trust me, parents are already saying no to fluoride and no to radiographs...and often they are spending thousands in treatments for composites, pulpotomies, etc. that could have been prevented. Dental health is overlooked so often in favor of extracirriculars. \"Sorry, Timmy has baseball practice so we need to reschedule/cancel.\" Ok, so Timmy is 7 years old, is a high caries risk, and hasn't seen us in 2 years. I think he can miss one fucking practice. People's priorities are alllll outta whack.\n\nWe get a lot of \"they won't let me brush their teeth!\" too. I'm sorry, who is the parent here? They're a small child, they need your guidance. I am empathetic to a point but you have to do it. If they didn't want to shit in the toilet, would you let them do it outside too? \n\nI fear we are going to get a lot busier. \ud83e\udd7a\n\nEDIT:\n\nWow ok, did not expect my comment to blow up. I just want to let yall know that I feel you on multiple fronts. I have a background in dental assisting, veterinary dentistry,  medical and dental research but now I work in the admin side of dentistry (not a dentist), so the financial issues and insurance issues I deal with on a daily basis are frustrating and heart breaking. It was the same when I worked in veterinary. As much as I wish we could do this fully subsidized, the USA hates universal health care and we have to make money to feed our staff. A lot of dentists, including my own, are eschewing being in network with a lot of insurances because they pay literal pennies for procedures. I'm talking about 15-20 bucks for full surgical procedures, which with how much dental school costs...it's not economical. I highly suggest to find a dentist that has a membership plan, it is often more cost effective than dental premiums!\n\nAs for health, if you truly don't want to give your kid flouride, there are alternatives that are NOT charcoal (seriously, don't! especially if theyre on meds!). Boka has nano hydroxyapatite toothpaste that has been clinically studied and is a great alternative. But I must insist you get radiographs, as the tooth is like an iceburg. A lot goes on underneath the surface. \n\nDentistry shouldn't be a luxury. I myself have talked to my local representatives about health care and dental care being my top concern and how we are doing nothing about it. My state, CA, can do better and I want it to be better. I wish I had all the solutions, I wish everyone here can get care. But please, do not yell at the staff if insurance isn't covering procedures. We literally can't control it. \ud83d\ude2d And I work with a dentist who would rather never see a cavity again. It is devastating to tell a parent their kid needs several crowns, pulpotomies, composites under anesthesia.",

Are the cops asking for the immigration status of everyone they pull over? Was she driving without a DL which triggers inquiry and then ICE arrives to detain her while they figure out if she's legal? Same with her father who got pulled over going 19mph over the limit. For most people, this is a ticket and then you go home. What is going on between them getting pulled over and detained so they end up with ICE? Because ICE can't pull people over.\n\nThere is no central registry of citizens. The only documents which prove your citizenship are your passport, naturalization certificate, or birth certificate, which most people don't carry with them at all times..

                "I work in peds dentistry and trust me, parents are already saying no to fluoride and no to radiographs...and often they are spending thousands in treatments for composites, pulpotomies, etc. that could have been prevented. Dental health is overlooked so often in favor of extracirriculars. \"Sorry, Timmy has baseball practice so we need to reschedule/cancel.\" Ok, so Timmy is 7 years old, is a high caries risk, and hasn't seen us in 2 years. I think he can miss one fucking practice. People's priorities are alllll outta whack.\n\nWe get a lot of \"they won't let me brush their teeth!\" too. I'm sorry, who is the parent here? They're a small child, they need your guidance. I am empathetic to a point but you have to do it. If they didn't want to shit in the toilet, would you let them do it outside too? \n\nI fear we are going to get a lot busier. \ud83e\udd7a\n\nEDIT:\n\nWow ok, did not expect my comment to blow up. I just want to let yall know that I feel you on multiple fronts. I have a background in dental assisting, veterinary dentistry,  medical and dental research but now I work in the admin side of dentistry (not a dentist), so the financial issues and insurance issues I deal with on a daily basis are frustrating and heart breaking. It was the same when I worked in veterinary. As much as I wish we could do this fully subsidized, the USA hates universal health care and we have to make money to feed our staff. A lot of dentists, including my own, are eschewing being in network with a lot of insurances because they pay literal pennies for procedures. I'm talking about 15-20 bucks for full surgical procedures, which with how much dental school costs...it's not economical. I highly suggest to find a dentist that has a membership plan, it is often more cost effective than dental premiums!\n\nAs for health, if you truly don't want to give your kid flouride, there are alternatives that are NOT charcoal (seriously, don't! especially if theyre on meds!). Boka has nano hydroxyapatite toothpaste that has been clinically studied and is a great alternative. But I must insist you get radiographs, as the tooth is like an iceburg. A lot goes on underneath the surface. \n\nDentistry shouldn't be a luxury. I myself have talked to my local representatives about health care and dental care being my top concern and how we are doing nothing about it. My state, CA, can do better and I want it to be better. I wish I had all the solutions, I wish everyone here can get care. But please, do not yell at the staff if insurance isn't covering procedures. We literally can't control it. \ud83d\ude2d And I work with a dentist who would rather never see a cavity again. It is devastating to tell a parent their kid needs several crowns, pulpotomies, composites under anesthesia.",

                "I work in peds dentistry and trust me, parents are already saying no to fluoride and no to radiographs...and often they are spending thousands in treatments for composites, pulpotomies, etc. that could have been prevented. Dental health is overlooked so often in favor of extracirriculars. \"Sorry, Timmy has baseball practice so we need to reschedule/cancel.\" Ok, so Timmy is 7 years old, is a high caries risk, and hasn't seen us in 2 years. I think he can miss one fucking practice. People's priorities are alllll outta whack.\n\nWe get a lot of \"they won't let me brush their teeth!\" too. I'm sorry, who is the parent here? They're a small child, they need your guidance. I am empathetic to a point but you have to do it. If they didn't want to shit in the toilet, would you let them do it outside too? \n\nI fear we are going to get a lot busier. \ud83e\udd7a\n\nEDIT:\n\nWow ok, did not expect my comment to blow up. I just want to let yall know that I feel you on multiple fronts. I have a background in dental assisting, veterinary dentistry,  medical and dental research but now I work in the admin side of dentistry (not a dentist), so the financial issues and insurance issues I deal with on a daily basis are frustrating and heart breaking. It was the same when I worked in veterinary. As much as I wish we could do this fully subsidized, the USA hates universal health care and we have to make money to feed our staff. A lot of dentists, including my own, are eschewing being in network with a lot of insurances because they pay literal pennies for procedures. I'm talking about 15-20 bucks for full surgical procedures, which with how much dental school costs...it's not economical. I highly suggest to find a dentist that has a membership plan, it is often more cost effective than dental premiums!\n\nAs for health, if you truly don't want to give your kid flouride, there are alternatives that are NOT charcoal (seriously, don't! especially if theyre on meds!). Boka has nano hydroxyapatite toothpaste that has been clinically studied and is a great alternative. But I must insist you get radiographs, as the tooth is like an iceburg. A lot goes on underneath the surface. \n\nDentistry shouldn't be a luxury. I myself have talked to my local representatives about health care and dental care being my top concern and how we are doing nothing about it. My state, CA, can do better and I want it to be better. I wish I had all the solutions, I wish everyone here can get care. But please, do not yell at the staff if insurance isn't covering procedures. We literally can't control it. \ud83d\ude2d And I work with a dentist who would rather never see a cavity again. It is devastating to tell a parent their kid needs several crowns, pulpotomies, composites under anesthesia.",

                "> Instead, the FDA will ask manufacturers to voluntarily pull their products, according to an administration official.\n\nIf I was a manufacturer, my reply to that ask would be \"fuck you.\"\n\n> FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said the products pose a risk when swallowed because they may interfere with healthy gut bacteria that are critical to digestion, immunity and other key bodily functions. \n\nMeanwhile, Brainworm is out there getting MAHA parents to [pump their kids full of vitamin A to toxic levels](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/04/07/vitamin-a-poisoning-measles-rfk-jr/).\n\nGovernment falling from the stupid tree and hitting every branch on the way down.",
