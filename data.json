The shortfall is due to bird flu, which has plagued the United States for several years.\n\nThe Finnish Poultry Association says it has been contacted about exporting eggs to the US. The organisation's executive director, Veera Lehtil\u00e4, told Yle on Saturday that exporting eggs does not seem to be possible at the moment because no market access negotiations have been held with US authorities.

                "FEMA defunded, government officials cannot travel with $1 credit card limit, and no leadership.",
                "Given the nature of climate change, this is only going to get worse, much worse.",

                "That's very sad and the number may rise after the fact, too. I hope those injured recover and the people impacted are able to repair/rebuild. \n\nAs an aside, Republicans like to go on about the government controlling the weather. Why didn't they just turn off the tornadoes? Weird that the republican-controlled government would do this to their own people, but i doubt you'll hear about this conspiracy theory like we did last hurricane season"
