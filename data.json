                "The NWS station in Jackson that is responsible for some of these areas is so understaffed that they close at night. The tornado that hit London, KY was very obviously dangerous and known to be on the ground for almost an hour before it hit the town. But proper alerts were not sent out to all the people that were sleeping because there was no one to send them. This is what everyone against the cuts was warning about.\n\nI want to edit to add that the Jackson, KY NWS personnel did the best they could. There were some staff present, but according to them, it was 4-5 people short of being ideal, again because of the funding cuts. I imagine burnout on nights like this is unavoidable. It was a chaotic night weather wise, and the few thousand dollars saved by short staffing these sights cost what is now up to over 20 lives.",

The fact detainees only receive notice \"roughly 24 hours before removal, devoid of information about how to exercise due process rights to contest that removal\" is an intended cruelty by this administration. They don't care if you're innocent or not, they will use every trick at their disposal to secure an express deportation so that once you're gone they can claim whatever they want about you.

Are you already familiar with the process or would you rely on Google and hope it all works out? Furthermore anyone familiar with federal offices know even the simplest of claims can be an excruciatingly slow process which begs the question, would your paperwork even reach anyone in time to contest your deportation?",
