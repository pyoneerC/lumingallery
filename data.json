                "\"Witnesses said the arrest came after Baraka attempted to join a scheduled tour of the facility with three members of New Jersey\u2019s congressional delegation, Reps. Robert Menendez, LaMonica McIver, and Bonnie Watson Coleman.\n\nWhen federal officials blocked his entry, a heated argument broke out, according to Viri Martinez, an activist with the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice. It continued even after Baraka returned to the public side of the gates.\n\n. . . \n\nIn video of the altercation shared with The Associated Press, a federal official in a jacket with the logo of the Homeland Security Investigations can be heard telling Baraka he could not join a tour of the facility because \u201cyou are not a congress member.\u201d\n\nBaraka then left the secure area, rejoining protesters on the public side of the gate. Video showed him speaking through the gate to a man in a suit, who informed him: \u201cThey\u2019re talking about coming back to arrest you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not on their property, they can\u2019t come out on the street and arrest me,\u201d Baraka replied.\n\nMinutes later several ICE agents, some wearing face coverings, surrounded Baraka and others on the public side of the gate. As protesters cried out, \u201cShame,\u201d Baraka was dragged back through the security gate in handcuffs.\"",

                "It\u2019s crazy that this was rejected because of US wariness and the stigma that they\u2019ll fail to feed the proposed percentage, so what?? Even if it was just 1% it\u2019s still better than nothing! Why does the US have to constantly be the one feeding the world\u2019s needy?!!? The US can\u2019t even feed its own people at home in the first place. \n\nI don\u2019t usually comment on this news feed but as someone that grew up in a food insecure house where for the first 5 years of my life I was fed solid food once every 3 days at most I say shame on anyone for denying this through. \n\nIm sure there\u2019s more to it and experts at higher levels know what they\u2019re doing, god I hope so cause they sure failed me, but this makes me so angry I can hardly type let alone think.",
