Another veteran said operators would carry AK-47 rifles which had a folding stock because they were easier to fit into their rucksacks and \"easier to bring onto a target and plant by a body\".\n\nOfficers would then help to falsify post-operational reports in order to avoid scrutiny for the actions of assault teams on the ground, according to the testimony.\n\n...\n\n\"If it looked like a shooting could represent a breach of the rules of conflict, you'd get a phone call from the legal adviser or one of the staff officers in HQ. They'd pick you up on it and help you to clarify the language. 'Do you remember someone making a sudden move?' 'Oh yeah, I do now.' That sort of thing. It was built into the way we operated.\"\n\nThe reports were \"a fiction\", another UKSF veteran said.\n\nAn intelligence officer who worked with the SBS described reports which said they had been caught in a firefight, while the photos showed bodies with \"multiple clean headshots\".\n\n...\n\nThe Afghan president was \"so consistent with his complaints about night raids, civilian casualties and detentions that there was no senior Western diplomat or military leader who would have missed the fact that this was a major irritant for him,\" said Gen Douglas Lute, a former US ambassador to Nato.\n\n...\"",

The agency said there were popping sounds on an unspecified number of radio frequencies. While air traffic controllers were able to communicate with aircraft, the radio system was not working correctly, prompting the switch to a backup system, the FAA said.\n\n>The incident marks the fourth time in the past two weeks that technical problems have disrupted air traffic at Newark Liberty.\n\n>On Friday morning, [radar screens at the airport went black](https://abcnews.go.com/US/radar-screens-newark-airport-black-overnight/story?id=121638395) for approximately 90 seconds, according to the FAA.

As a result, the FAA halted all departures to the Newark airport, citing \"telecommunications and equipment issues at Philadelphia TRACON.\"\n\n>ABC News also confirmed a minor outage at Newark Liberty that occurred on April 30.\n\n>Following the April 29 outage, several controllers went on medical leave, calling the experience a traumatic event.

                "*Article Text by Jennifer Ludden:* \n\nThe Food and Drug administration has approved the U.S.'s first at-home alternative to the Pap smear, a procedure generations of women have dreaded and often found painful.\n\nThe new device by Teal Health will offer a \"much preferred experience,\" the company said in its announcement, and also aims to increase screening rates by making the procedure more convenient.\n\nTraditionally, gynecologists have inserted a cold metal speculum deep into a woman's vagina to scrape cells from the cervix.\n\nThe Teal Wand \u2014 \"built with empathy,\" the company said \u2014 uses a swab to collect a vaginal sample. Women will then mail the sample to a lab that will screen for HPV (human papillomavirus), the virus that causes nearly all cervical cancers. A growing body of research has found HPV testing to be highly accurate.\n\nThe FDA approval Friday follows a U.S.-based study that found at-home screening was just as effective as that done in a doctor's office. The study also found women overwhelmingly preferred self\u2013screening at home, and said they'd be more likely to stay up to date with cervical cancer screenings that way.\n\nEvery year, about 13,000 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed, and more than 4,000 women die from the disease. Rates are down dramatically since Dr. Georgios Papanicolaou published a 1943 paper on how to use the Pap smear for screening, and it then became common.\n\nBut about a quarter of women in the U.S. are behind on such screenings, and medical experts say reducing that is key to the ultimate goal of eliminating cervical cancer. There's also a racial gap, with Black and Native American women far more likely to die from cervical cancer than white women. The HPV vaccine for teen and preteen girls, introduced in 2007, has also led to a global push to tackle the disease that way.\n\nAt-home cervical cancer screenings are already available in several other countries, including Australia and Sweden.\n\nTeal Health says its self-testing device will be available starting next month, in California first and then expanding.

In all, about 30 people were rescued.\n\n>Authorities have not said how the fire might have started.\n\n>Lipski said the building did not have a sprinkler system and was built in 1968, predating a law that would have required one, according to the fire chief.\n\n>\u201cIf we had sprinklers in the buidling we would have stopped the fire very, very small.

One of the five -- a 33-year-old man -- was experiencing a medical emergency, according to the Pinal County Sheriff's Office.\n\n>Civilians from within the hiking party attempted to initiate CPR, according to the Superstition Fire and Medical District, which serves Gold Canyon.\n\n>Rescue teams took over CPR efforts upon reaching the scene, but \"unfortunately the patient did not survive,\" SFMD said in a statement.\n\n>Temperatures in the area were close to 100 degrees on Sunday, and the medical emergency was linked to the heat.\n\n>\"No foul play is suspected,\" PCSO said. \"The Pinal County Medical Examiner will determine the cause of death.\"\n\n>\"Tragically this mountain rescue resulted in one fatality,\" SFDM said in a statement on Facebook, adding that the other four in the group were assisted down the mountain but \"refused transport to the hospital.\"\n\n>Officials encouraged people to avoid Wave Cave Trail for the remainder of the day on Sunday.\n\n>SFMD added an advisory to its social media post, saying that Arizona summers can reach upward of 110 F and \"heat exhaustion or heat stroke can occur in under an hour.\"\n\n>\"Most heat deaths happen on trails between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., the hottest part of the day,\" the post continued.\n\n>\"If you feel dizzy, nauseous, stop sweating, or become confused, get help immediately,\" SFMD added. \"Please stay safe and plan wisely.

The agency said there were popping sounds on an unspecified number of radio frequencies. While air traffic controllers were able to communicate with aircraft, the radio system was not working correctly, prompting the switch to a backup system, the FAA said.\n\n>The incident marks the fourth time in the past two weeks that technical problems have disrupted air traffic at Newark Liberty.\n\n>On Friday morning, [radar screens at the airport went black](https://abcnews.go.com/US/radar-screens-newark-airport-black-overnight/story?id=121638395) for approximately 90 seconds, according to the FAA. During the outage, which occurred at about 3:55 a.m. ET, air traffic controllers could be heard telling a FedEx plane that their screens had gone dark and then asking the aircraft to tell their company to apply pressure to get the problem fixed.\n\n>In another transmission, a controller told an arriving private jet that the airport just had experienced a brief radar outage and to stay at or above 3,000 feet in case the controllers couldn't get in touch during the aircraft's descent.\n\n>The FAA said that the Friday outage stemmed from a \"telecommunications outage that impacted communications and radar display at Philadelphia TRACON Area C,\" which is the facility that covers the airspace around Newark.\n\n>On April 28, an [outage at Newark Liberty](https://abcnews.go.com/US/newark-airport-outage-week-lasted-60-90-seconds/story?id=121484044) caused air traffic control computer screens to go dark for roughly 60 to 90 seconds and also prevented the controllers from talking to aircraft during the outage, multiple sources with knowledge of the incident told ABC News. As a result, the FAA halted all departures to the Newark airport, citing \"telecommunications and equipment issues at Philadelphia TRACON.\"\n\n>ABC News also confirmed a minor outage at Newark Liberty that occurred on April 30.\n\n>Following the April 29 outage, several controllers went on medical leave, calling the experience a traumatic event.

                "*Article Text by Jennifer Ludden:* \n\nThe Food and Drug administration has approved the U.S.'s first at-home alternative to the Pap smear, a procedure generations of women have dreaded and often found painful.\n\nThe new device by Teal Health will offer a \"much preferred experience,\" the company said in its announcement, and also aims to increase screening rates by making the procedure more convenient.\n\nTraditionally, gynecologists have inserted a cold metal speculum deep into a woman's vagina to scrape cells from the cervix.\n\nThe Teal Wand \u2014 \"built with empathy,\" the company said \u2014 uses a swab to collect a vaginal sample. Women will then mail the sample to a lab that will screen for HPV (human papillomavirus), the virus that causes nearly all cervical cancers. A growing body of research has found HPV testing to be highly accurate.\n\nThe FDA approval Friday follows a U.S.-based study that found at-home screening was just as effective as that done in a doctor's office. The study also found women overwhelmingly preferred self\u2013screening at home, and said they'd be more likely to stay up to date with cervical cancer screenings that way.\n\nEvery year, about 13,000 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed, and more than 4,000 women die from the disease. Rates are down dramatically since Dr. Georgios Papanicolaou published a 1943 paper on how to use the Pap smear for screening, and it then became common.\n\nBut about a quarter of women in the U.S. are behind on such screenings, and medical experts say reducing that is key to the ultimate goal of eliminating cervical cancer. There's also a racial gap, with Black and Native American women far more likely to die from cervical cancer than white women. The HPV vaccine for teen and preteen girls, introduced in 2007, has also led to a global push to tackle the disease that way.\n\nAt-home cervical cancer screenings are already available in several other countries, including Australia and Sweden.\n\nTeal Health says its self-testing device will be available starting next month, in California first and then expanding. It will be by prescription, through a telehealth service, for women 25-65 years old who are \"at average risk.\" The company says it's working with insurance companies to provide coverage.",
