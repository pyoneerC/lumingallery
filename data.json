                "from the article:\n\n26 March 2025\n\nLUCAS COUNTY \u2014 A person died from rabies after receiving a transplanted organ in Lucas County earlier this year:\n\n>The recipient, who had undergone a kidney transplant in December, contracted the viral disease through the donated organ, according to the Toledo-Lucas County Health Department, WTOL reported.\n\n>As the recipient was from Michigan, Michigan\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services worked with the Ohio Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to investigate the case.\n\n>It marks the first human case of rabies in Michigan since 2009, according to WTOL.\n\n>No additional individuals are at risk of rabies exposure, according to the CDC.\n\n>Kara Steele, a representative from Life Connection of Ohio, could not comment on the specific case but explained to WTOL that a donor risk assessment interview is conducted before any organ donation.\n\n>The identities of both the recipient and the donor have not been released.\n\n>The facility where the transplant took place has also not been disclosed. \n\n>However, according to the University of Toledo Medical Center\u2019s website, it is the only organ transplant center in northwest Ohio.\n\n>Fewer than 10 people in the United States die from rabies each year, according to the CDC.",

                "Maybe this is a question for a different subreddit.\n\nIf they figured this out shortly after the transplant could the recipient be saved by getting the rabies vaccine?    I am wondering if this is similar to having been bitten... it is in your body but is hasn't gotten into... the nerves(?) enough that the vaccine can help.  Maybe a transplant would be too much rabies all at once or in the wrong part of your body for the rabies treatment to be effective.",

The man she was visiting has been charged with murder in connection with her killing, Riebe said.\n\n>Dowells, a hairdresser, was killed while visiting her husband, David Brinson, 54, who was convicted in the 1990s of murdering four men during a robbery, and sentenced to four consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole.\n\n>After Brinson called prison officials at 2:04 a.m. on Nov. 13 to tell them his wife had passed out, officers immediately began life-saving measures and called 911, a spokesperson for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said. \n\n>But Dowells was pronounced dead a short time later.\n\n>Dowells\u2019 killing remains under investigation by prison officials and the district attorney\u2019s office, the spokesperson said. \n\n>Riebe said charges are pending prison and autopsy reports.",

Later on when I went to work at a nearby casino, one of my reports was a former corrections officer at that prison and he told me that most of those guys are \"short-timers\" or had mild offenses on good behavior. I asked \"Has anybody run off before?\" He says \"Of course. These guys are the dumbest guys on the planet. One fellow had his girlfriend pick him up in the parking lot and they took off.

                "#Copper\u2019s on Fire as Trump Tariff Talk Sparks Record-Breaking Price Surge\n\nCopper, usually the quieter cousin to gold in the metals world, has suddenly stolen the spotlight. Prices for the red metal have rocketed to an all-time high in New York, fuelled by whispers that President Donald Trump may slap tariffs on copper imports far sooner than markets had expected.\n\nTraders had been banking on autumn for any big changes, but reports on Wednesday suggested tariffs might land within weeks. That was all the spark Wall Street needed. Copper futures leapt to an eye-watering $5.374 per pound before cooling slightly to settle at $5.24, still a record. For context, copper has surged 30 per cent this year alone, outpacing even gold, which is having a strong year itself. The stock markets, meanwhile, are still playing catch-up.\n\nThe surge is being driven less by traditional demand and more by panic buying. US firms, anxious to get ahead of any new import charges, are snapping up copper as quickly as they can. Analysts believe around 500,000 tons are being shipped to American ports this month, a massive jump from the usual 70,000 tons. Goldman Sachs thinks that figure could rise by another 200,000 tons in April.\n\nIt\u2019s a classic case of buy now, worry later. Traders are front-running the tariffs, trying to stockpile before prices go even higher. As one analyst put it, the mere suggestion of tariffs has sent copper into a frenzy. The result is a growing gap between copper prices in New York and London, where the metal has also climbed but not nearly as dramatically.\n\nCopper may not be classed as a rare earth mineral, nor does it feature among the US\u2019s 50 \u201ccritical minerals\u201d, but it remains vital. It is used everywhere from electronics to energy systems to national defence. The US Department of Energy even called it a \u201ccritical material for energy\u201d back in 2023. With such wide-ranging uses, any disruption to supply has ripple effects.\n\nInterestingly, this price spike is not being driven by ordinary consumer demand. It is more about shifting stockpiles and geopolitical chess moves. Trump recently signed an executive order to investigate the national security risks of importing copper, a move that many see as paving the way for yet another tariff.\n\nThe frenzy is already having global consequences. Analysts warn that the US copper grab could leave other countries short, and with the world expected to meet only 70 per cent of copper demand by 2035, that is a real concern. Throw in a recent production cut from Glencore in Chile, and the copper market looks increasingly tight.\n\nDespite the buzz, not everyone is convinced the price surge will last. Once the stockpiling rush subsides, we may see a correction. But for now, copper is having its moment, and the markets are watching every move from the White House with bated breath.",
                "Oh I get it now. This is to curb inflation. See\u2026 if copper is expensive then pennies can buy more goods. There are 100 pennies in a dollar, so that must be true for paper dollars too. and boom national debt is gone! \n\nThere is the plan folks!",
                "The copper was stolen out of the parking lot lights at my gym twice in one year. It\u2019s about to happen again. Hopefully the weld the access covers in preparation."
