However, I stopped shopping there about 2 years ago, so I cant speak on the quality currently. Although I have been in their stores since then and it appears to me that the quality is still continuing to decline.\n\nThey're also heavily reliant on fast fashion trends (see denim jean boots currently on their website), which many consumers aren't as interested in purchasing anymore. Shein, temu, fashion nova, and so many other online companies offer the same quality and styles for a fraction of the price as well for consumers who do still want fast fashion trends. F21 still charges the same amount (or even more) for their clothes as when they had somewhat okay quality, far less fast fashion competition, and more consumer demand for their clothing styles.\n\nI saw a jacket on their website selling for $60. cheap, mass produced fast fashion is not worth $60 to begin with. the same item can be found on shein for like $20. Most people will opt for shein if they want that item. \n\nI am Canadian, so I cant speak for American stores, but in canada the stores are consistently unpleasant to be in. Always understaffed, always insanely unorganized and every display is constantly messy, huge lack of consistency in what each location has available, store is also just generally \"trashy\" (for lack of a better word) with shotty lighting, no renovations made after whatever store occupied the space before f21, signs never accurate. It honestly looks like something out of the backrooms, but messier. The store quality really strongly reflects the product quality.\n\nI totally get why this store is going under. They dont have anything that makes them competitive or enticing to consumers compared to any other fast fashion retailer. They cheapened out their products to the point they're either fully unwearable or the product is such an ugly monstrosity that no one will even buy it, while still charging like they have any quality left. They have no care for consumer satisfaction, of course people dont want to buy from them.",

They knew the judge was ruling on this situation. They knew they could have had the plane wait until the ruling came down to have it deport these people IF it was legal. They knew what they were doing was illegal anyways. **They still did it**.\n\nLet me also be clear, this is not about gang members. If these people truly were members of a Venezuelan gang, then go through due process AND THEN deport them. Same result. This is about pushing our due process to it's limits to see what you can get away with, then justifying it with \"Oh well it was gang members, you don't want gang members here DO YOU?\", and the entire point is \"How do WE know they were gang members if you rounded them up and deported them without any due process?\".\n\nTHAT'S THE ENTIRE POINT.

Hair resigned the day before a scheduled administrative interrogation.\u00a0\n\nAnyway, while there are flaws with this system, like a 3-year time limit to investigate and make a decision, it's at least a step in the right direction to getting these people off the force.

However, I stopped shopping there about 2 years ago, so I cant speak on the quality currently. Although I have been in their stores since then and it appears to me that the quality is still continuing to decline.\n\nThey're also heavily reliant on fast fashion trends (see denim jean boots currently on their website), which many consumers aren't as interested in purchasing anymore. Shein, temu, fashion nova, and so many other online companies offer the same quality and styles for a fraction of the price as well for consumers who do still want fast fashion trends. F21 still charges the same amount (or even more) for their clothes as when they had somewhat okay quality, far less fast fashion competition, and more consumer demand for their clothing styles.\n\nI saw a jacket on their website selling for $60. cheap, mass produced fast fashion is not worth $60 to begin with. the same item can be found on shein for like $20. Most people will opt for shein if they want that item. \n\nI am Canadian, so I cant speak for American stores, but in canada the stores are consistently unpleasant to be in. Always understaffed, always insanely unorganized and every display is constantly messy, huge lack of consistency in what each location has available, store is also just generally \"trashy\" (for lack of a better word) with shotty lighting, no renovations made after whatever store occupied the space before f21, signs never accurate. It honestly looks like something out of the backrooms, but messier. The store quality really strongly reflects the product quality.\n\nI totally get why this store is going under. They dont have anything that makes them competitive or enticing to consumers compared to any other fast fashion retailer. They cheapened out their products to the point they're either fully unwearable or the product is such an ugly monstrosity that no one will even buy it, while still charging like they have any quality left.

However, I stopped shopping there about 2 years ago, so I cant speak on the quality currently. Although I have been in their stores since then and it appears to me that the quality is still continuing to decline.\n\nThey're also heavily reliant on fast fashion trends (see denim jean boots currently on their website), which many consumers aren't as interested in purchasing anymore. Shein, temu, fashion nova, and so many other online companies offer the same quality and styles for a fraction of the price as well for consumers who do still want fast fashion trends. F21 still charges the same amount (or even more) for their clothes as when they had somewhat okay quality, far less fast fashion competition, and more consumer demand for their clothing styles.\n\nI saw a jacket on their website selling for $60. cheap, mass produced fast fashion is not worth $60 to begin with. the same item can be found on shein for like $20. Most people will opt for shein if they want that item. \n\nI am Canadian, so I cant speak for American stores, but in canada the stores are consistently unpleasant to be in. Always understaffed, always insanely unorganized and every display is constantly messy, huge lack of consistency in what each location has available, store is also just generally \"trashy\" (for lack of a better word) with shotty lighting, no renovations made after whatever store occupied the space before f21, signs never accurate. It honestly looks like something out of the backrooms, but messier. The store quality really strongly reflects the product quality.\n\nI totally get why this store is going under. They dont have anything that makes them competitive or enticing to consumers compared to any other fast fashion retailer. They cheapened out their products to the point they're either fully unwearable or the product is such an ugly monstrosity that no one will even buy it, while still charging like they have any quality left.
