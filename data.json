                "An overview of what\u2019s known so far:\n- Charles Faggart was arrested April 1 in Jacksonville, Florida on two misdemeanor charges: simple assault and criminal mischief.\n- On April 7, an \u201cincident\u201d involving eight Jacksonville Sheriff\u2019s Office correctional officers and one correctional sergeant occurred at the Jacksonville jail. (Faggart was subsequently hospitalized, but it\u2019s been known by loved ones since that day that he was brain dead.)\n- On April 8, Jacksonville Sheriff T.K. Waters announced the suspension of the officers, saying that the injuries to the inmate (the sheriff\u2019s office did not identify him as Faggart) were \u201cbad, very bad, bad enough for me to come out here and tell the public about it.\"\n- On April 9, Sheriff Waters announced that the sheriff\u2019s office was requesting the involvement of the FBI in the investigation into the \u201cincident\u201d.\n- On April 10, the family attorney announced Faggart\u2019s death.\n\nNo details or video of the incident or the names of the officers involved have been released.",
