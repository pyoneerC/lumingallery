I don\u2019t believe he poses a risk to the community,\u201d said Poole. \u201cThe evidence from the video, and I won\u2019t comment on what I think the video really shows, as far as guilt or innocence. It\u2019s not my job today. But the facts do show me that he hung around, and I don\u2019t find that he\u2019s a flight risk based upon what I saw in the video,\u201d Poole said.\n\nSo they claim he tried to snatch a child, but then he just stuck around the store continuing his shopping?
