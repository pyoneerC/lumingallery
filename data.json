CECOT is the same prison that Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited last week, recording videos for social media while standing in front of a cell packed with silent detainees.\n\n>If the government wants to deport someone with protected status, the standard course would be to reopen the case and introduce new evidence arguing for deportation. The deportation of a protected-status holder has even stunned some government attorneys I\u2019ve been in touch with who are tracking the case, who declined to be named because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak to the press. \u201cWhat.
