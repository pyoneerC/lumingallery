                "Finding the deposit is \"easy\".\n\nMining it is a little trickier.\n\nTurning it into \\_\\_usable\\_\\_ lithium. Thats the HARD part that needs a lot of infrastructure, power and skill.\n\nThere is a new one under construction in California. Its a $1.8Bln facility, owned by an Australian company. Otherwise the ore has to be export to Australia, Chile or China. The US does have some other processing capabilities, but its mostly the Aussies with the know-how (I guess it involves using shitty beer to do it? j/k). \n\nBear in mind that if its processed abroad thats 2 x shipping costs, plus hazards materials handling, plus a tariff.\n\nSo that $1.8Bln plant, even if its a smaller facility, will be really useful! But its not going to be able to handle all of it, or in a timely manner.\n\nThis is a good link for more info: [Lithium Supply Chain: Understanding the Basics | Shipping and Commodity Academy](https://shippingandcommodityacademy.com/blog/lithium-supply-chain-understanding-the-basics/) (other pages exist but they all say about the same thing. Obviously the \"US reserves\" are now slightly higher than on that page mind).",

                "For those unaware, the U.S. has lithium in a ton of places but as of now the only real site that is extracting lithium in any meaningful capacity is in Nevada. There is a site that has been identified for development in Arizona as well.\n\nBut all of that is sort of moot because right now virtually all REFINING of lithium has to go through China so absent developing that domestic refining we won\u2019t be gaining independence any time soon.",
                "There are many sites with (BIG NUMBER) valued lithium.  The problem was how much the extraction and refining cost compared to (BIG NUMBER).  It frequently translated to close to, or exceeded,  (BIG NUMBER).\n\n  \nJust like there are a number of 'rare earth mineral' deposits in the U.S....they just aren't practical to extract.",
                "It's never the issue whether we have lithium mine or not. We always have the. It's just the environmental cost to mine and produce it.",
                "If you've ever been out there - it seems like nothing but desert and high desert/mountains,  but look at the area as the watershed that feeds into the Columbia river and the underground aquifers that also feed into the Columbia river and all the tributaries hence forth.\n\nThey can't just go in their and extract it if it's going to hurt the watersheds of the west.\n\nI worked near two superfund sites - I live near superfund site about 15 miles south of me.\n\nExamples:\n\nThe entire south end of Vashon Island and Ruston area (Tacoma WA metro) is contaminated with exaust tailings to the point where plants harvested there contain those chemicals like lead to this day. (There's a summer camp there that predates the smokestacks that kids roll around in the dirt right THERE.) \n\nIn Butte, Montana and subsequently a 200 mile radius and anywhere in the MT/WY/NV area there are both smokestack areas of contamination and pools of deadly chemicals leftover from the 1800s-1970s. Pools of arsenic and lead. If you've been there you know.  Cows and horses just walk around grazing in these areas.\n\nPicher, Oklahoma - \"the most toxic ghost town\" in the USA. The entire story is a trip. Silent Hill type stuff. I went to a museum exhibit on it in Norman.\n\nEdmond, OK - currently having to treat it's watershed contaminated with fracking juices - oh but they won't tell you that.  They just want to see you bougie houses and ride out the earthquakes.  (source - Geologist who works for oil company who quit over it I dated - so dubious.) \n\nQuestion is not \"We make money now\"\n\nbut \"Where will we live AFTER the mine closes and we don't make money anymore?\"\n\nExample of Lithium Extract- from source:\n\n# Brine Extraction\n\nBrine extraction is another method of extracting lithium. This method involves pumping brine from underground aquifers into evaporation ponds. The sun and wind evaporate the water, leaving behind lithium and other minerals. The following are the steps involved in brine extraction:\n\n* Drilling: Wells are drilled into the ground to access the brine.\n* Pumping: The brine is pumped to the surface and transported to the evaporation ponds.\n* Evaporation: The brine is evaporated in the ponds, leaving behind lithium and other minerals.\n* Processing: The extracted lithium is then processed to produce lithium carbonate or other lithium compounds.\n\nBrine extraction is a less costly and less energy-intensive method of extracting lithium. It is also less harmful to the environment than hard rock mining. However, it is highly dependent on weather conditions, and the process can take several months to complete.\n\nOverall, both hard rock mining and brine extraction have their advantages and disadvantages. Companies choose the method that suits their needs and resources.\n\n#"

Thats the HARD part that needs a lot of infrastructure, power and skill.\n\nThere is a new one under construction in California. Its a $1.8Bln facility, owned by an Australian company. Otherwise the ore has to be export to Australia, Chile or China. The US does have some other processing capabilities, but its mostly the Aussies with the know-how (I guess it involves using shitty beer to do it? j/k). \n\nBear in mind that if its processed abroad thats 2 x shipping costs, plus hazards materials handling, plus a tariff.\n\nSo that $1.8Bln plant, even if its a smaller facility, will be really useful! But its not going to be able to handle all of it, or in a timely manner.\n\nThis is a good link for more info: [Lithium Supply Chain: Understanding the Basics | Shipping and Commodity Academy](https://shippingandcommodityacademy.com/blog/lithium-supply-chain-understanding-the-basics/) (other pages exist but they all say about the same thing. Obviously the \"US reserves\" are now slightly higher than on that page mind).",

(There's a summer camp there that predates the smokestacks that kids roll around in the dirt right THERE.) \n\nIn Butte, Montana and subsequently a 200 mile radius and anywhere in the MT/WY/NV area there are both smokestack areas of contamination and pools of deadly chemicals leftover from the 1800s-1970s. Pools of arsenic and lead. If you've been there you know.  Cows and horses just walk around grazing in these areas.\n\nPicher, Oklahoma - \"the most toxic ghost town\" in the USA. The entire story is a trip. Silent Hill type stuff. I went to a museum exhibit on it in Norman.\n\nEdmond, OK - currently having to treat it's watershed contaminated with fracking juices - oh but they won't tell you that.  They just want to see you bougie houses and ride out the earthquakes.  (source - Geologist who works for oil company who quit over it I dated - so dubious.) \n\nQuestion is not \"We make money now\"\n\nbut \"Where will we live AFTER the mine closes and we don't make money anymore?\"\n\nExample of Lithium Extract- from source:\n\n# Brine Extraction\n\nBrine extraction is another method of extracting lithium. This method involves pumping brine from underground aquifers into evaporation ponds. The sun and wind evaporate the water, leaving behind lithium and other minerals. The following are the steps involved in brine extraction:\n\n* Drilling: Wells are drilled into the ground to access the brine.\n* Pumping: The brine is pumped to the surface and transported to the evaporation ponds.\n* Evaporation: The brine is evaporated in the ponds, leaving behind lithium and other minerals.\n* Processing: The extracted lithium is then processed to produce lithium carbonate or other lithium compounds.\n\nBrine extraction is a less costly and less energy-intensive method of extracting lithium. It is also less harmful to the environment than hard rock mining. However, it is highly dependent on weather conditions, and the process can take several months to complete.\n\nOverall, both hard rock mining and brine extraction have their advantages and disadvantages. Companies choose the method that suits their needs and resources.\n\n#"

                "*Article Excerpt from Jackie Wattles (CNN):*\n\nA Soviet-era spacecraft that was designed to make a soft landing on Venus \u2014 but instead remained trapped in Earth orbit for decades \u2014 is slated to fall from the sky Friday night or early Saturday, according to the latest estimates from experts.\n\nThe object, referred to as Cosmos 482 or Kosmos 482, is believed to be a capsule launched by the Soviet Union in March 1972 that failed en route to a transfer orbit that would have taken it to Venus to study its environment.\n\nIn the decades since, the object has circled Earth aimlessly as it was slowly dragged back toward home.\n\nAstronomers and space traffic experts have had their eyes on the object for years now as its orbital path has slowly reached lower and lower altitudes, a result of the subtle atmospheric drag that exists even hundreds of miles away from Earth.\n\nThe cylinder-shaped craft, which is about 3 feet (1 meter) in diameter, is now predicted to crash back to Earth overnight. Cosmos 482 is on track to hit the ground or ocean roughly between 10 p.m. and 6:30 a.m. ET, according to four analyses of the object from various institutions, including the European Space Agency and the federally funded US research group Aerospace Corporation.\n\nThat guidance is still in line with predictions issued by space traffic experts earlier this week. The estimated time frame of the vehicle\u2019s final descent will narrow as the event approaches.\n\nBecause of the sheer complexity of spaceflight and unpredictable factors, such as space weather, it can be extremely difficult to pinpoint exactly when or where an object will fall out of orbit.\n\nThis particular piece of space junk likely won\u2019t pose a risk to people on the ground.\n\n\u201cThis object was designed to survive reentering Venus, so there\u2019s fair odds that it\u2019ll survive coming back (to Earth) in one piece,\u201d said Marlon Sorge, a space debris expert with The Aerospace Corporation, on Monday. \u201cThat actually makes the risk less \u2026 because it would stay intact.\u201d",

                "from the article:\n\u201cWhat to do if you spot debris:\n\nWhile a landing on dry ground is unlikely, it\u2019s not impossible. The Cosmos 482 object\u2019s trajectory shows it could hit anywhere within a broad swath of land that includes \u201cthe whole of Africa, South America, Australia, the USA, parts of Canada, parts of Europe, and parts of Asia,\u201d said Marco Langbroek, a lecturer and space traffic expert at Delft Technical University in the Netherlands, via email.\n\nSorge emphasized that if Cosmos 482 hits the ground after its final descent tonight, onlookers are advised to keep their distance. The aged spacecraft could leak dangerous fuels or pose other risks to people and property.\n\u201cContact the authorities,\u201d Sorge urged. \u201cPlease don\u2019t mess with it.\u201d",

Is this it skipping off the atmosphere? An artifact of how altitude is reported, over land of changing heights? Or something else?\n\n***Edit***: *oh; duh. Its orbit is currently a (decaying) elliptical. It's just rising back towards apogee.*",
                "I think I remember Taco Bell putting a target out in the Pacific one of these times. I believe if the satellite hit the target, everyone in the US would get a free taco. \n\n\nIt didn't hit. The odds were astronomical.",

(There's a summer camp there that predates the smokestacks that kids roll around in the dirt right THERE.) \n\nIn Butte, Montana and subsequently a 200 mile radius and anywhere in the MT/WY/NV area there are both smokestack areas of contamination and pools of deadly chemicals leftover from the 1800s-1970s.

This method involves pumping brine from underground aquifers into evaporation ponds. The sun and wind evaporate the water, leaving behind lithium and other minerals. The following are the steps involved in brine extraction:\n\n* Drilling: Wells are drilled into the ground to access the brine.\n* Pumping: The brine is pumped to the surface and transported to the evaporation ponds.\n* Evaporation: The brine is evaporated in the ponds, leaving behind lithium and other minerals.\n* Processing: The extracted lithium is then processed to produce lithium carbonate or other lithium compounds.\n\nBrine extraction is a less costly and less energy-intensive method of extracting lithium. It is also less harmful to the environment than hard rock mining. However, it is highly dependent on weather conditions, and the process can take several months to complete.\n\nOverall, both hard rock mining and brine extraction have their advantages and disadvantages. Companies choose the method that suits their needs and resources.\n\n#"
