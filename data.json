                "An Illinois man has been sentenced to 53 years in prison for the\u00a02023 fatal stabbing\u00a0of a 6-year-old Palestinian-American boy.\n\nWadee Alfayoumi was stabbed 26 times and his mother more than a dozen in the Oct. 14, 2023, attack inside their home in the Chicago suburb of Plainfield.\n\nTheir landlord, 73-year-old Joseph Czuba, was convicted in February on multiple murder charges, as well as attempted murder, aggravated battery and hate crime counts. A Will County jury found Czuba guilty of all counts after deliberating for less than two hours.\n\nAuthorities said he targeted his tenants because they were Muslim and in response to the war between Israel and Hamas that had just ignited after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.\n\nWadee's great uncle, Mahmoud Yousef, addressed the sentencing outside the courthouse, telling reporters, \"It doesn't matter what numbers are. He took a life from us. He took a future.\"\n\nThe child's mother, Hanan Shaheen, was the first to take the stand in the weeklong trial.\n\nShe said Czuba attacked her first with a knife, stabbing her multiple times, saying, \"You devil Muslim, you must die,\" as her son watched, according  to\u00a0WLS, which was in the courtroom.\n\nShe testified that she called 911 from the bathroom when he appeared to leave, but then she started to hear her son screaming, according to WLS.\n\n\"I started hearing my son screaming, screaming, screaming, 'Oh no, stop,'\" Shaheen said, according to WLS.\n\nJurors also listened to the mother's 911 call from the bathroom, in which she was heard telling the dispatcher, \"He's killing my baby,\" WLS reported.\n\nJurors additionally heard remarks Czuba made in a law enforcement vehicle following the attack.\n\n\"I thought they were going to do jihad on me,\" Czuba said, according to WLS.\n\nHe also said he was \"afraid for my life\" and his wife and said the family was \"just like infested rats,\" according to\u00a0WLS.",

He took a life from us. He took a future.\"\n\nThe child's mother, Hanan Shaheen, was the first to take the stand in the weeklong trial.\n\nShe said Czuba attacked her first with a knife, stabbing her multiple times, saying, \"You devil Muslim, you must die,\" as her son watched, according  to\u00a0WLS, which was in the courtroom.\n\nShe testified that she called 911 from the bathroom when he appeared to leave, but then she started to hear her son screaming, according to WLS.\n\n\"I started hearing my son screaming, screaming, screaming, 'Oh no, stop,'\" Shaheen said, according to WLS.\n\nJurors also listened to the mother's 911 call from the bathroom, in which she was heard telling the dispatcher, \"He's killing my baby,\" WLS reported.\n\nJurors additionally heard remarks Czuba made in a law enforcement vehicle following the attack.\n\n\"I thought they were going to do jihad on me,\" Czuba said, according to WLS.\n\nHe also said he was \"afraid for my life\" and his wife and said the family was \"just like infested rats,\" according to\u00a0WLS.",

He took a life from us. He took a future.\"\n\nThe child's mother, Hanan Shaheen, was the first to take the stand in the weeklong trial.\n\nShe said Czuba attacked her first with a knife, stabbing her multiple times, saying, \"You devil Muslim, you must die,\" as her son watched, according  to\u00a0WLS, which was in the courtroom.\n\nShe testified that she called 911 from the bathroom when he appeared to leave, but then she started to hear her son screaming, according to WLS.\n\n\"I started hearing my son screaming, screaming, screaming, 'Oh no, stop,'\" Shaheen said, according to WLS.\n\nJurors also listened to the mother's 911 call from the bathroom, in which she was heard telling the dispatcher, \"He's killing my baby,\" WLS reported.\n\nJurors additionally heard remarks Czuba made in a law enforcement vehicle following the attack.\n\n\"I thought they were going to do jihad on me,\" Czuba said, according to WLS.\n\nHe also said he was \"afraid for my life\" and his wife and said the family was \"just like infested rats,\" according to\u00a0WLS.",
