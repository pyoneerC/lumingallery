Cutting nearly half a department overnight, with barely a warning, is not streamlining, it is sabotage. Even if you believe the Department of Education is bloated, you do not fix a system by gutting it in a way that leaves staff terrified and scrambling. \n\nPeople do not work well under fear, and a government that rules through uncertainty is more interested in control than competence. The bigger question is what comes next. If this is just the warm-up act for dismantling the department altogether, what does that mean for the millions of students and families who rely on federal education programmes? Anyone cheering this move might want to ask themselves whether they trust their local politicians to handle education funding fairly and effectively because that is where this is headed.",

Cutting nearly half a department overnight, with barely a warning, is not streamlining, it is sabotage. Even if you believe the Department of Education is bloated, you do not fix a system by gutting it in a way that leaves staff terrified and scrambling. \n\nPeople do not work well under fear, and a government that rules through uncertainty is more interested in control than competence. The bigger question is what comes next. If this is just the warm-up act for dismantling the department altogether, what does that mean for the millions of students and families who rely on federal education programmes? Anyone cheering this move might want to ask themselves whether they trust their local politicians to handle education funding fairly and effectively because that is where this is headed.",
