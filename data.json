                "You all would be shocked at how infrequently they went after parents who hurt their children. I would say it was less than 2%. \n\nI used to do this job. A solid third of my cases were bullshit weed and custody cases that no one cared about. There just weren't enough resources to care about this.\n\nAnother third was abject poverty and people living in falling apart plywood trailers with no plumbing or electricity in the middle of Texas summer. Obviously you can't have a newborn baby living in 110\u00b0 shed. Usually for that we would cram them in with the very unwilling family member and call it a day. There wasn't enough money to do anything else. \n\nA third of my cases were teen parents who didn't know any better and often didn't care but sometimes were trying. It's hard to be 15 and have a baby of your own when you're living on someone's couch. We usually got another unwilling family member to help supervise in these situations and called it a day. There wasn't enough money to do anything else. \n\nIn a perfect world I would have gotten them all affordable housing and healthcare and birth control and education and government IDs and bus passes and nutrition and clothes and sooooooo muchhhhhh therapyyyyyyy. \n\nA small portion of my cases were absolute monsters who needed to be locked up and so many of them escaped any sort of actual punishment. Again because of resources. \n\nVery frequently we terminated rights for shit parents but that's usually because the parents didn't even make an effort to complete the court required programs they were ordered to do. Simple stuff like parenting classes and showing up to visits and paying $10 a month in child support. Half the time they didn't even show up. I would tell them in person and in writing and tell the attorney \"hey this person has court on this date if they want to continue being a parent they need to show up.\" Nothing.\n\nParents who actually made even a half-assed effort got their kids back unless they were complete monsters like incest/rapists.",

Below 'beyond a reasonable doubt'. \n\n>Court documents allege in March 2020, Stary had grabbed her then 9-year-old son by the back of his head, beat his face on the hardwood floor and carpet, then continued to beat his bruised face as his nose began to bleed. Stary was arrested and charged with injuring a child, a third-degree felony.\n\nShe was given a lifetime protective order against all her children.

Stary would not be allowed to see or directly contact her kids indefinitely.\n\nthe kids calling for help 11 times.. FFS and what happened with abandoning one on the drive from colorado to texas.

                "You all would be shocked at how infrequently they went after parents who hurt their children. I would say it was less than 2%. \n\nI used to do this job. A solid third of my cases were bullshit weed and custody cases that no one cared about. There just weren't enough resources to care about this.\n\nAnother third was abject poverty and people living in falling apart plywood trailers with no plumbing or electricity in the middle of Texas summer. Obviously you can't have a newborn baby living in 110\u00b0 shed. Usually for that we would cram them in with the very unwilling family member and call it a day. There wasn't enough money to do anything else. \n\nA third of my cases were teen parents who didn't know any better and often didn't care but sometimes were trying. It's hard to be 15 and have a baby of your own when you're living on someone's couch. We usually got another unwilling family member to help supervise in these situations and called it a day. There wasn't enough money to do anything else. \n\nIn a perfect world I would have gotten them all affordable housing and healthcare and birth control and education and government IDs and bus passes and nutrition and clothes and sooooooo muchhhhhh therapyyyyyyy. \n\nA small portion of my cases were absolute monsters who needed to be locked up and so many of them escaped any sort of actual punishment. Again because of resources. \n\nVery frequently we terminated rights for shit parents but that's usually because the parents didn't even make an effort to complete the court required programs they were ordered to do. Simple stuff like parenting classes and showing up to visits and paying $10 a month in child support. Half the time they didn't even show up. I would tell them in person and in writing and tell the attorney \"hey this person has court on this date if they want to continue being a parent they need to show up.\" Nothing.\n\nParents who actually made even a half-assed effort got their kids back unless they were complete monsters like incest/rapists.",
                ">Terminating parental rights requires a higher burden of proof \u2014 trial courts must find the evidence \u201cclear and convincing.\u201d\n\nClear and convincing is the medium level of proof. Below 'beyond a reasonable doubt'. \n\n>Court documents allege in March 2020, Stary had grabbed her then 9-year-old son by the back of his head, beat his face on the hardwood floor and carpet, then continued to beat his bruised face as his nose began to bleed. Stary was arrested and charged with injuring a child, a third-degree felony.\n\nShe was given a lifetime protective order against all her children. She now gets a new hearing with the new standard needing to be applied.",
                "I thought this was about ICE and am now disappointed.",
                "My cousin fostered and eventually adopted a baby who's addict parents fed him meth, more than once.  The judge kept insisting the baby needed to go to his biological family.  My cousin had to hire two lawyers to finally adopt him.\n\nFuck this state.  Fuck this state so much.",
                "from the click through.. of course this wasnt the only incident with her\n\n>During protective order hearings over the course of several months, Ethridge testified about the March 2020 incident and several previous instances in which he said Stary beat the children, forced them to sleep outside on the porch and abandoned one of their daughters on the side of the road during a drive back from Colorado.\n\n>The kids called the police for help at least six times, and Child Protective Services was contacted at least five times, according to court records.\n\n>After interviews with the children, a Harris County district court judge went a step further \u2014 she issued a lifetime protective order. Stary would not be allowed to see or directly contact her kids indefinitely.\n\nthe kids calling for help 11 times.. FFS and what happened with abandoning one on the drive from colorado to texas. Sounds like she should have had kids taken away a long time ago.",
                "So the standard is still below that needed for a conviction, and only even that high for permanent protective orders?\n\nThat sounds reasonable? Am I missing something?\n\n>Stary was arrested and charged with injuring a child, a third-degree felony.\n\nIf this woman beat her kid bloody, the should be convicted for that, which would require a higher burden of proof than terminating her parental rights.",
                "I was a public health nurse and some parents should lose custody before destroying their children.",
                "Obviously doesn't apply to citizens at the border.\u00a0",
                "\"...in cases of white american parents who beat their children\"\n\nThey're NOT talking about ICE separating migrant parents from their children. \n\nBecause of course they aren't.",
                "Hot take, if you literally ever hit your kid hard enough to make them bleed, and to be clear you shouldn't hit your kid at all, but if you ever hit them hard enough to make them bleed then you should never be allowed to see them again, ever. Not ever."
