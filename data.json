The President, all the way down to your local small town mayor, are taxpayer employees, who are there to efficiently administer all of the taxpayer dollars for the benefit of the taxpayers.  We don\u2019t owe any politician any allegiance or fealty.  They are not our overlords or kings.  Tax money isn\u2019t their discretion, although some politicians are allowed a small stipend for discretionary funds.  When programs are paid for to benefit taxpayers, it isn\u2019t some grand benevolence; that\u2019s the actual purpose of the tax dollars.  The rich like to call it \u201cwelfare\u201d because they want to make you think entitlement is a bad word.  Yes, people are entitled to enjoy the benefits for which their tax dollars are purposed.   Tax dollars were never meant to exist to further enrich already-wealthy citizens.  Period.",
