If these people truly were members of a Venezuelan gang, then go through due process AND THEN deport them. Same result. This is about pushing our due process to it's limits to see what you can get away with, then justifying it with \"Oh well it was gang members, you don't want gang members here DO YOU?\", and the entire point is \"How do WE know they were gang members if you rounded them up and deported them without any due process?\".\n\nTHAT'S THE ENTIRE POINT.
