Thus tens of millions of people get different I information, news, facts, truths, etc than tens of millions of others. \n\nThat is the ONLY way you achieve what this nation has in the past decade. \n\nThirty years ago, Trump would have been laughed out of the 2015 primaries. \n\nBut after 30+ years (starting in the 1990s) of partisan based escalating Culture War for profit, by the time the \u201cage of information\u201d took hold half the country was just ready and waiting for an anti-lib media ecosystem. \n\nThey had Rush and Fox News and in the days before the World Wide Web was truly ubiquitous that was more than enough to make billions off culture war. But it wasn\u2019t enough to truly alter/diverge realities. The way information traveled was still \u201cslow\u201d. Outlets, regardless of lean were all still covering the same basic news stories. Average Americans may have had bias one way or the other, but they still all got more or less the same basic information from which to understand the world. \n\nBut that stopped being true once the flood gates of digital media opened, and they technology of targeted advertising became the number one business model in the digital age. \n\nThe barrier of entry was lowered so much that millions could start a blog, a community, or a \u201cnew media\u201d company. Better yet, there are nearly no rules to how you create and spread information online. Your voice, for free, can carry equal weight to a press outlet that has to pay researchers, editors, reporters, fact checkers, and journalists. Your voice can EARN as much as outlets that  have basic news gathering and reporting standards and practices. \n\nThere was never a version of this world where real news gathering/reporting and real journalism were ever going to survive in the face of millions of people who can just blast their opinions and hot takes. Especially when ad sales platforms do not care what those opinions and hot takes are. Especially when millions of people don\u2019t care if what they say is accurate, true, or even in good faith. \n\nAnd all of the above is BEFORE social media, with its engagement and personalization algos, and it\u2019s built in incentives to create and spread as much content as possible. \n\nWE\n\nARE\n\nBROKEN",

But it wasn\u2019t enough to truly alter/diverge realities. The way information traveled was still \u201cslow\u201d. Outlets, regardless of lean were all still covering the same basic news stories. Average Americans may have had bias one way or the other, but they still all got more or less the same basic information from which to understand the world. \n\nBut that stopped being true once the flood gates of digital media opened, and they technology of targeted advertising became the number one business model in the digital age. \n\nThe barrier of entry was lowered so much that millions could start a blog, a community, or a \u201cnew media\u201d company.

Your voice can EARN as much as outlets that  have basic news gathering and reporting standards and practices. \n\nThere was never a version of this world where real news gathering/reporting and real journalism were ever going to survive in the face of millions of people who can just blast their opinions and hot takes. Especially when ad sales platforms do not care what those opinions and hot takes are. Especially when millions of people don\u2019t care if what they say is accurate, true, or even in good faith. \n\nAnd all of the above is BEFORE social media, with its engagement and personalization algos, and it\u2019s built in incentives to create and spread as much content as possible. \n\nWE\n\nARE\n\nBROKEN",

And while the process to advance the standards has drawn ire from members of Oklahoma's majority party, the question of the standards' content has gotten little pushback.\"\n\n\"The new standards have been championed by Ryan Walters, the state superintendent of public instruction and a conservative firebrand.\"\n\n#  \"These new standards will ensure that kids have an accurate and comprehensive view of historical events, while also reinforcing the values that make our country great,\" Walters said at a February State Board of Education meeting.\n\n\"The new standards were\u00a0[quietly introduced just hours before that February meeting](https://www.kgou.org/education/2025-04-24/oklahoma-board-of-ed-pushes-back-on-social-studies-standards-senate-gop-poised-to-reject-them), and Walters falsely told board members that to make legislative deadlines, the standards needed to be approved that day. They were.\"\n\n\"While the standards are set to go into effect next school year, a lawsuit filed by a GOP former Oklahoma attorney general could stall their implementation.\"\n\n\"But like other criticisms coming from Republicans, the lawsuit calls out problems in the approval process \u2014 not the standards themselves.\"",

Thus tens of millions of people get different I information, news, facts, truths, etc than tens of millions of others. \n\nThat is the ONLY way you achieve what this nation has in the past decade. \n\nThirty years ago, Trump would have been laughed out of the 2015 primaries. \n\nBut after 30+ years (starting in the 1990s) of partisan based escalating Culture War for profit, by the time the \u201cage of information\u201d took hold half the country was just ready and waiting for an anti-lib media ecosystem. \n\nThey had Rush and Fox News and in the days before the World Wide Web was truly ubiquitous that was more than enough to make billions off culture war. But it wasn\u2019t enough to truly alter/diverge realities. The way information traveled was still \u201cslow\u201d. Outlets, regardless of lean were all still covering the same basic news stories. Average Americans may have had bias one way or the other, but they still all got more or less the same basic information from which to understand the world. \n\nBut that stopped being true once the flood gates of digital media opened, and they technology of targeted advertising became the number one business model in the digital age. \n\nThe barrier of entry was lowered so much that millions could start a blog, a community, or a \u201cnew media\u201d company. Better yet, there are nearly no rules to how you create and spread information online. Your voice, for free, can carry equal weight to a press outlet that has to pay researchers, editors, reporters, fact checkers, and journalists. Your voice can EARN as much as outlets that  have basic news gathering and reporting standards and practices. \n\nThere was never a version of this world where real news gathering/reporting and real journalism were ever going to survive in the face of millions of people who can just blast their opinions and hot takes. Especially when ad sales platforms do not care what those opinions and hot takes are. Especially when millions of people don\u2019t care if what they say is accurate, true, or even in good faith. \n\nAnd all of the above is BEFORE social media, with its engagement and personalization algos, and it\u2019s built in incentives to create and spread as much content as possible. \n\nWE\n\nARE\n\nBROKEN",
