The teen said that they had been to a couple of homes in the neighborhood and that he was not familiar with the area.\"\n\nAt 3am? They decide it's a good idea to ring people's doorbells?

Wreckage can confirm that.\n\nPakistan has acknowledged one air defence installation was hit where 4 soldiers were injured\n\nThe Indian reddit army is strong and wants to change the narrative by upvoting/downvoting but it isn't working.\n\nThe jets were shot down the night before, now the drones and Pakistan has still only defended itself.",
