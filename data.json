                "Doctors Without Borders physicians are heroic humanitarians who forgo making lots of money and put themselves in harm's way simply because it's the right thing to do. I worked alongside some of them in Bangaldesh during the Rohingya refugee crisis and was extremely impressed. This is the best of humanity. It's an absolute disgrace that an American university would disinvite their former head over some slides--apparently because they were offensive in their veracity."

                "As an ICU nurse I\u2019ve never ever ever ever heard a doctor say \u201cyou have 4 days to live.\u201d First of all no knows if it\u2019s 1 hour or a month. They can tell you if care is futile and won\u2019t benefit the patient. Having said that, renal failure is not a death sentence. It\u2019s a very difficult life with dialysis catheters and potentially a fistula. There could be intentional deception of lack of understand and fear combined to make that leap. However, her claims against Prince Amdrew have been corroborated with evidence and I 100% believe her.",
                "Something is going on in her life. The photo in this news article and the caption was shared on her instagram one day ago. \n\n\nThe post before the car crash post is about her kids, dated March 22, and says:\n\n\n\u201cMy beautiful babies have no clue how much I love them and they're being poisoned with lies. I miss them so very much. I have been through hell & back in my 41 years but this is incredibly hurting me worse than anything else.\nHurt me, abuse me but don't take my babies. My heart is shattered and every day that passes my sadness only deepens\u201d",
                "not a doctor, but i believe renal failure if very treatable with dialysis.  not sure how she would die in days when she's in the hospital if that's the main medical issue.",
                "Just to throw this out there\u2014she is not a doctor. She probably heard something like \u201cIf you go home without treatment, you could be dead within four days due to kidney failure.\u201d I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s intentionally mischaracterizing her condition; I think she just misunderstood.\n\nThey are not going to keep her in the hospital until she dies in four days. She will probably make a full recovery.",
                "\"In a post on Instagram, Virginia Guiffre said she was in a car that was hit by a school bus \"driving 110km [68.3mph] as we were slowing for a turn\".\n\n\n\n\nDid they turn across the schoolbus trying to make a highway exit?\n\n\n\n\nI just can't see where you'd find a sharp turn and a schoolbus doing 70mph in the same place?",

                "ICU doctor here. It seems likely that this woman has misinterpreted something her care team told her. Perhaps the real message is \u201cwithout therapy for your kidney failure you would probably die in about x days\u201d. Don\u2019t be too hard on her, ICU stays can be very disorienting, with medications, sleep deprivation and emotional response to the injury making things difficult. But it is very unlikely that a person well enough to post on social media is about to die despite modern intensive care.",
