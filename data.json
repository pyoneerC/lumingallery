                "*\u201dOne of the officers shot the 18-year-old as he emerged from between two dumpsters, the body cam video showed. On the footage, moments before the shooting another officer can be heard yelling, \u2018He\u2019s got a gun! He\u2019s got a gun! On your right! On your right!\u2019*\n\n*The officer said after the shooting that the 18-year-old appeared to point the gun at him, according to Theetge.*\u201d\n\n**If**(!!!) this is true it sounds about as justified as it can get.\n\nNot to mention the cop he killed was just some random guy directing traffic\u2026 I\u2019ll wait until more evidence comes out before forming an opinion of the son but the dad sounds like an absolute POS.\n\nEdit: also the guy he killed was a retired reserve cop. The dude was just an old man that probably just wanted to do something to keep himself busy. One of my coworkers does this kind of thing. He\u2019s in his 60s and dresses up like a cop every two months to direct traffic at football games lol. I\u2019m not convinced he even gets paid to do it",
