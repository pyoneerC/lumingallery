Fuck them.\n\nJoshlin's grandmother fought tooth and nail to get custody of Joshlin and her siblings before this happened, but the social services failed spectacularly - the grandma said that Joshlin's mother made their lives hell and abused and neglected all the kids - but still she retained custody for some ungodly reason.\n\nThis is a failure of state and a testament to the fact that South Africa do not care about their children - every day there's a story of a child found raped and murdered under some bush, and still nothing is being done by the government.",

It had dropped\u00a0roughly 20% below\u00a0the mark last month, when fears were at their worst about whether Trump\u2019s trade war would drive the economy into a recession.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 60 points, or 0.1%, as of 9:35 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 1.3% higher.\n\nThe gains were even bigger in Asia, where markets had the first chance to react to the ruling issued late on Wednesday by the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York. It said that the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act that Trump cited for ordering massive\u00a0increases in taxes on imports worldwide\u00a0does not authorize the use of tariffs.\n\n*The White House immediately appealed, and the long-term outcome of legal disputes over tariffs remains uncertain. The court\u2019s\u00a0ruling also affects only some of Trump\u2019s tariffs, not those on foreign steel, aluminum and autos, which were invoked under a different law.*\n//"

It had dropped\u00a0roughly 20% below\u00a0the mark last month, when fears were at their worst about whether Trump\u2019s trade war would drive the economy into a recession.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 60 points, or 0.1%, as of 9:35 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 1.3% higher.\n\nThe gains were even bigger in Asia, where markets had the first chance to react to the ruling issued late on Wednesday by the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York. It said that the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act that Trump cited for ordering massive\u00a0increases in taxes on imports worldwide\u00a0does not authorize the use of tariffs.\n\n*The White House immediately appealed, and the long-term outcome of legal disputes over tariffs remains uncertain. The court\u2019s\u00a0ruling also affects only some of Trump\u2019s tariffs, not those on foreign steel, aluminum and autos, which were invoked under a different law.*\n//"

It had dropped\u00a0roughly 20% below\u00a0the mark last month, when fears were at their worst about whether Trump\u2019s trade war would drive the economy into a recession.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 60 points, or 0.1%, as of 9:35 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 1.3% higher.\n\nThe gains were even bigger in Asia, where markets had the first chance to react to the ruling issued late on Wednesday by the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York. It said that the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act that Trump cited for ordering massive\u00a0increases in taxes on imports worldwide\u00a0does not authorize the use of tariffs.\n\n*The White House immediately appealed, and the long-term outcome of legal disputes over tariffs remains uncertain. The court\u2019s\u00a0ruling also affects only some of Trump\u2019s tariffs, not those on foreign steel, aluminum and autos, which were invoked under a different law.*\n//"
