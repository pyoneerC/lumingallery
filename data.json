                ">Skeletal remains found on New Jersey beaches decades ago have been identified as those of a 19th-century schooner captain, thanks to the investigative efforts of college students.\u00a0\n\n>The ship, the Oriental, sank in 1844. The schooner was transporting 60 tons of marble from Connecticut to Philadelphia to be used in the construction of Girard College, which still operates today. The ship likely sprung a leak, according to a\u00a0[news release announcing the identification](https://www.ramapo.edu/news/press-releases/bone-fragments-found-on-new-jersey-beaches-linked-to-19th-century-shipwreck/)\u00a0of the remains, and sank off the coast of Brigantine Shoal. All five crew members aboard the ship died.\u00a0\n\n>The skeletal remains, including a skull, were found on a number of South Jersey beaches between 1995 and 2013. The set of remains became known as \"Scattered Man John Doe.\" Police efforts to identify the bones failed.\u00a0\n\n>In 2023, the New Jersey State Police partnered with Ramapo College's Investigative Genetic Genealogy Center. A sample from the bones was uploaded to genetic genealogy company Intermountain Forensics, which submitted it to DNA matching sites in February 2024. Meanwhile, students at Ramapo used the profile for research.\n\n>They found ancestry matches dating back to the 1600s, including genetic relatives from Connecticut. For the next year, students continued to find ties to Connecticut, and eventually they started looking at shipwrecks off the coast of New Jersey. They came upon two articles about the sinking of the Oriental. One\u00a0[article](https://www.ramapo.edu/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/118/2025/05/image001-1.png)\u00a0named the crew members aboard at the time of the sinking and\u00a0[another](https://www.ramapo.edu/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/118/2025/05/unnamed.png)\u00a0detailed the wreck itself.\u00a0\n\n>\"The storm was so tremendous that no help could be given from the shore,\" said the article, which was published in the Boston Daily Bee in December 1844 and described an account from a Connecticut publication.\u00a0\n\n>According to the article, one crew member was \"decently buried\" after his \"corpse was thrown on the shore.\" No other bodies were discovered immediately after the sinking.\u00a0\n\nCreepy story, considering the ship sank in 1844 and remains were found between 1995 and 2013. Great work by the students; they were able to identify the captain and can now give him a proper burial.",

                "I wonder if these remains were the ones \"decently buried\"?  Would seem likely that a \"decently buried\" corpse might be buried slightly inland.  Over the years the shoreline probably eroded until the bones became exposed and found by passers-by.  I would think that a simple drowned person in the sea might wash ashore, but being in the intertidal zone is pretty hard on a body and it would have disintegrated and eroded away many decades prior.  Just my guess.",

                ">Skeletal remains found on New Jersey beaches decades ago have been identified as those of a 19th-century schooner captain, thanks to the investigative efforts of college students.\u00a0\n\n>The ship, the Oriental, sank in 1844. The schooner was transporting 60 tons of marble from Connecticut to Philadelphia to be used in the construction of Girard College, which still operates today. The ship likely sprung a leak, according to a\u00a0[news release announcing the identification](https://www.ramapo.edu/news/press-releases/bone-fragments-found-on-new-jersey-beaches-linked-to-19th-century-shipwreck/)\u00a0of the remains, and sank off the coast of Brigantine Shoal. All five crew members aboard the ship died.\u00a0\n\n>The skeletal remains, including a skull, were found on a number of South Jersey beaches between 1995 and 2013. The set of remains became known as \"Scattered Man John Doe.\" Police efforts to identify the bones failed.\u00a0\n\n>In 2023, the New Jersey State Police partnered with Ramapo College's Investigative Genetic Genealogy Center. A sample from the bones was uploaded to genetic genealogy company Intermountain Forensics, which submitted it to DNA matching sites in February 2024. Meanwhile, students at Ramapo used the profile for research.\n\n>They found ancestry matches dating back to the 1600s, including genetic relatives from Connecticut. For the next year, students continued to find ties to Connecticut, and eventually they started looking at shipwrecks off the coast of New Jersey. They came upon two articles about the sinking of the Oriental. One\u00a0[article](https://www.ramapo.edu/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/118/2025/05/image001-1.png)\u00a0named the crew members aboard at the time of the sinking and\u00a0[another](https://www.ramapo.edu/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/118/2025/05/unnamed.png)\u00a0detailed the wreck itself.\u00a0\n\n>\"The storm was so tremendous that no help could be given from the shore,\" said the article, which was published in the Boston Daily Bee in December 1844 and described an account from a Connecticut publication.\u00a0\n\n>According to the article, one crew member was \"decently buried\" after his \"corpse was thrown on the shore.\" No other bodies were discovered immediately after the sinking.\u00a0\n\nCreepy story, considering the ship sank in 1844 and remains were found between 1995 and 2013. Great work by the students; they were able to identify the captain and can now give him a proper burial.",

                "I wonder if these remains were the ones \"decently buried\"?  Would seem likely that a \"decently buried\" corpse might be buried slightly inland.  Over the years the shoreline probably eroded until the bones became exposed and found by passers-by.  I would think that a simple drowned person in the sea might wash ashore, but being in the intertidal zone is pretty hard on a body and it would have disintegrated and eroded away many decades prior.  Just my guess.",

They gave a name back to someone lost for generations and gave his family something they never thought they\u2019d get: closure.",
                ">Skeletal remains found on New Jersey beaches decades ago have been identified as those of a 19th-century schooner captain, thanks to the investigative efforts of college students.\u00a0\n\n>The ship, the Oriental, sank in 1844. The schooner was transporting 60 tons of marble from Connecticut to Philadelphia to be used in the construction of Girard College, which still operates today. The ship likely sprung a leak, according to a\u00a0[news release announcing the identification](https://www.ramapo.edu/news/press-releases/bone-fragments-found-on-new-jersey-beaches-linked-to-19th-century-shipwreck/)\u00a0of the remains, and sank off the coast of Brigantine Shoal. All five crew members aboard the ship died.\u00a0\n\n>The skeletal remains, including a skull, were found on a number of South Jersey beaches between 1995 and 2013. The set of remains became known as \"Scattered Man John Doe.\" Police efforts to identify the bones failed.\u00a0\n\n>In 2023, the New Jersey State Police partnered with Ramapo College's Investigative Genetic Genealogy Center. A sample from the bones was uploaded to genetic genealogy company Intermountain Forensics, which submitted it to DNA matching sites in February 2024. Meanwhile, students at Ramapo used the profile for research.\n\n>They found ancestry matches dating back to the 1600s, including genetic relatives from Connecticut. For the next year, students continued to find ties to Connecticut, and eventually they started looking at shipwrecks off the coast of New Jersey. They came upon two articles about the sinking of the Oriental. One\u00a0[article](https://www.ramapo.edu/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/118/2025/05/image001-1.png)\u00a0named the crew members aboard at the time of the sinking and\u00a0[another](https://www.ramapo.edu/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/118/2025/05/unnamed.png)\u00a0detailed the wreck itself.\u00a0\n\n>\"The storm was so tremendous that no help could be given from the shore,\" said the article, which was published in the Boston Daily Bee in December 1844 and described an account from a Connecticut publication.\u00a0\n\n>According to the article, one crew member was \"decently buried\" after his \"corpse was thrown on the shore.\" No other bodies were discovered immediately after the sinking.\u00a0\n\nCreepy story, considering the ship sank in 1844 and remains were found between 1995 and 2013. Great work by the students; they were able to identify the captain and can now give him a proper burial.",

                "I wonder if these remains were the ones \"decently buried\"?  Would seem likely that a \"decently buried\" corpse might be buried slightly inland.  Over the years the shoreline probably eroded until the bones became exposed and found by passers-by.  I would think that a simple drowned person in the sea might wash ashore, but being in the intertidal zone is pretty hard on a body and it would have disintegrated and eroded away many decades prior.  Just my guess.",

Many other Soviet citizens were sent to the gulag, a grim network of prison camps, spread across the world\u2019s largest country.\n\n>The Moscow metro said in a statement that the new version of the monument, which was presented to the public on May 15, was one of its \u201cgifts\u201d to passengers to mark the 90th anniversary of the sprawling, ornate and famously efficient transportation system.\n\n>The work\u2019s original title, \u201cGratitude of the People to the Leader and Commander,\u201d was dedicated to Stalin\u2019s role in delivering victory for the Soviet Union in World War II, the 80th anniversary of which Russia\u00a0[marked with pomp this year](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/09/europe/russia-victory-day-parade-intl-hnk).\n\n>\u201cThis man (Stalin), he created a lot,\u201d said Yevgeny Ivanov, a Moscow resident, who had come to look at the new monument on Wednesday. \u201cHe has something to be proud of. And it is not for us to tear it down. A man did something - we must respect what he did.\u201d\n\n>Kirill Frolov, another resident of the capital, said he accepted that Stalin\u2019s record was mixed and that you couldn\u2019t call him \u201cgood.\u201d\n\nPutin won't mind bringing back the tyrants of the past.",

In his 1913 to 1916 Siberian exile as \u201cpolitical\u201d he was living with real political communist Yakov Sverdlov, which he was constantly bullying and scoffing for his \u201cclean look and behaviour\u201d he got the dog and called it \u201cYashka\u201d to piss off Yakov.
