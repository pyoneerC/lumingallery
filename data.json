I suspect she had the same sort of relationship with the next guy she started dating - because I know she was very upset with him.  showed up at a bar, and acted all drunk, and brought him out to her car, where she had sex with him.  he went back into the bar and she ran in and said he raped her.  \n\nThe guy was taken away in handcuffs, and couldn't believe what was happening to him.  She eventually came clean, but the damage was done - the dude had mugshots, and was arrested in the middle of a crowded bar.  she didn't get so much as a slap on the wrist.  From what I understand, the guy was just so happy to have the charges dropped against him.  But he should have pressed charges against her for the damage she did to him.  \n\nThis was about 20 years ago that this happened.  and I still worry about how I was just a few months away from being 'the guy' in this story.",

Can go much deeper in to the story but I won\u2019t bore y\u2019all. It was scary. She knew my address, phone number (land line back then) my vehicle, my overall everything. I was at my GF\u2019s house after school, did some day boozing, walked 2 blocks home, and went to bed. Then I was \u201cwoken up\u201d about 4 hours later. Lots of people I\u2019ve told the story too have said \u201cI\u2019ve had handled it this way\u201d. But I was woken up from a dead sleep, completely confused, 3 cops screaming at me, my dad freaking out, my mom in hysterics. \n\nThere were no consequences for the accuser.
