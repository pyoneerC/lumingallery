That is so appalling and crazy that there must be something that we are missing in this whole mess.\n\nWas there someone/something there that he was desperately trying to avoid? Was he entangled in something extremely illegal?\n\nEDIT: This is fascinating, according to another article I pulled up, he was charged with:\n\n\nAt least six counts of inducing panic\n\nThree counts of terroristic threats\n\nTelecommunications fraud\n\nObstructing official business\n\nFalsification\n\nTwo counts of forgery\n\nPossessing criminal tools\n\n\n\nbut pleaded down to charges of two counts of felony inducing panic and one count of falsification and served 6 months.

Aliza claimed that the suspect would be late for meetings and wouldn\u2019t respond to her texts and emails. He also delayed the divorce proceedings numerous times because he didn\u2019t feel fully prepared, which meant that Aliza had been living in fear of her estranged husband for several months by the time she was murdered.  \n\nSource: https://clevelandmagazine.com/in-the-cle/the-read/articles/aliza-sherman",
