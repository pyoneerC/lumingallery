        - &gt;In the lead up to Trump‚Äôs inauguration, Ratcliffe and the Trump transition team were told of the value of intelligence sharing with Ukraine by US officials who stressed that it was a hallmark of their achievements on the battlefield, according to a source familiar with the discussions.

Well, that's something, isn't it.
        - Just in case anyone believed that it was ever actually about the money and not an ideological desire to support Russia in the war.
        - Sooner or later the US will share their intelligence support to its new closest ally: Russia.
        - Better headline:  
\&gt; Russian Agent has paused US intelligence sharing with Ukraine
        - If not Russian asset, why Russian asset shaped?
        - The whole world is about to shift away from America and conservatives are going to wonder what happened in a decade.
        - Intelligence in the United States has been paused as well.
        - Ukraine should expel all CIA assets in their country to prevent the US from sharing intelligence data with Russia. Maybe expel US diplomats and close the US embassy, too.  It's obvious, that the US has chosen sides against Ukraine, so just make it official and kick the US out.
        - Ah yes surely ruining our NATO alliance and letting a country that pushes people out windows take the lead in Europe is healthy.
        - They've paused intelligence alright¬†

        - I'm curious why a non medical professional is allowed to have this cabinet position. There should be a law requiring MD or DO credentials. 

If a licensed doctor gave misinformation publicly, he could be sanctioned by the medical board, making the MD requirement a safeguard against abuse.
        - At a time when parents are staging measles parties, we need someone who advocates for proper prevention via vaccination. Instead we get this guy. The measles parties are absolutely insane to me, and I am so pissed at parents putting their kids at risk like that.
        - I love how Trump surrounds himself with the best and brightest people unlike Biden who chose merely competent people. /s
        - If only there was a way to prevent measles

gee, i wonder why the rest of the developed world doesnt have this problem
        - CEOs, politicians, public figures, etc, need to practice what they preach.  
  
RFK should host a measles party.   
Elon should try to live on a bus driver's wage.  
Marco Rubio should move to Ukraine.

Do that for a month and then we'll entertain your harebrained ideas.
        - No, see, to cure a deadly disease you don't need medicine or vaccines, you just need more Vitamin D.

        - Feel like lots of people cheering on the federal government layoffs are going to be in for a rude awakening when suddenly there's 10x as many people applying for each open private sector job.
        - Virginia's governor had a whole press conference where he unveiled this website to help federal workers who had been laid off to find new jobs. 

The website is literally just links to LinkedIn and Indeed.
        - Y‚Äôall better buckle tf up because we are headed straight for a massive recession. 

‚úÖHundreds of thousands of newly out of work employees competing for a shrinking pool of private sector jobs

‚úÖTariffs causing inflation 

‚úÖGovernment accountability and enforcement on financial institutions becoming non-existent

Cannot overstate how perfect of an economic storm is brewing right now. But thank god the right finally owned us queer-loving liberal pansies.
        - Our country is being crippled by the current administration and our economy is in a downward spiral. Of course there are fewer jobs being offered.
        - This is exactly what so many people wanted. 

To get fired from their well paying and financially sound government employment so they can : *checks notes* work at Home Depot. 

Awesome.
        - Did you like the Great Depression? Well, good news, it's back! We've got isolationism! We've got protectionism! We've got the rise of fascism! All the greatest hits!
        - Giant agribusiness Corp I'm at is on an indefinite hiring freeze because of tariffs. Guess where their PAC $ went.
        - Think about how many federal workers Musk and Trump have fired.

They are part of the problem.
        - Reminder how the far left claimed the Dems didn't help the the everyday worker enough. This is what a party that doesn't care about anyone but the ultra wealthy does. We tried to get you to vote. Don't fuck it up again if you get another chance.

        - So is this the part where they try to rehire people and put them through political screening first? Or is this the part where they pretend like the mass firings never happened so that they can't get sued?
        - "The¬†[memo](https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=https://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/athena/files/2025/03/04/67c74950e4b0b4e940709591.pdf)¬†states that instead, federal offices now have until September 13 to determine how to reduce staff."

Not reversed but delayed. IE my bullshit is tanking the economy so we need to spread out the bullshit.
        - He will reverse it again.
        - How much more evidence does anyone need that *these fucking idiots have no idea what they‚Äôre doing, and have no actual plan*?
        - Trump is not mentally capable to manage a small convenient store.

What kind of president is this?
        - Whether he reverses it again or not - hopefully by now people can see this man and his cabinet are not qualified. They are not working in the interests of Americans who elected confessional representatives for the services they wanted and needed. 

People can disagree about what those are and what extent they should be - but for one man to appoint an unelected man who was *not* vetted by Congress to just fire people or remove entire sections of government established to serve the citizens proves Trump and his group are not just unqualified but dangerous idiots who serve corporate, billionaire, and Russian interests before ours. 

If your house and senators oppose impeaching him and his crew - then it should be the obligation of every American to make it clear *their* jobs are on the line.
        - it would be hilarious if he blames Elon for the stock market tanking and puts apartheid clyde in jail.
        - At this point, can we 25th amendment him? He clearly has no idea WTF he's doing.
        - THE ARTICLE TITLE IS MISLEADING AND A LIE. 

Trump didnt do anything and the EOs and Presidential memorandums directing for a massive downsizing of the federal government are still in place. All that happened was that the Office of Personnel and Management (OPM), which is kinda like the whole governments HR and who makes policies, rescinded a memo that they wrote implementing the Presidential EOs and Memoranda. This was done because OPM can‚Äôt legally tell other departments to fire people and the Courts have pointed that out in some injunctions and court cases that have been brought. 

THIS MEMO BEING RESCINDED DOES NOTHING OTHER THAN TELL AGENCIES THEY NEED TO MAKE THE DETERMINATION TO FIRE PROBATIONARY (new) EMPLOYEES ‚ÄòTHEMSELVES‚Äô. The government is still going to fire all these new employees just it would be at ‚Äòagency discretion‚Äô.  And just removes a very low hanging fruit for these wrongfully terminated employees to be fired over. 

and we are already seeing this happen. The DoD yesterday signed a memo that says ‚Äú the Department is taking independent steps to reduce the size of the civilian workforce.‚Äù

        - Dismantle and privatize.  Vets will be left to try and fend for themselves with private healthcare and mental health. Many times not available in rural America.

Even if they find care, how many are ready to help with ptsd, cronic illnesses from chemicals, burn pits etc.  

The vets in this country deserve better.
        - 83,000?!?

83,000 families suddenly looking for jobs as the number of jobs decrease because we're in a fucking trade war with our biggest trading partners
        - This is the party that claims they support the veterans.
        - Yet another thing republicans pretend to stand for but actually dont
        - So my wife is a Dr at the VA and has to schedule her patient's appointments because they don't have people to do that.  Let that sink in for a second.


Recently she was told that they're going to hold them to the same standard as private practice doctors, who have a support staff that does this kind of thing for them.  They're expected to be as efficient as private practice doctors but not get paid the same or have the same support staff. This is definitely not about efficiency.   If you care about veterans, complain because they're about to get fucked.
        - A lot of Veterans work at the VA...like wtf.
        - Cool, because who cares about getting prompt care for long-term service connected injuries? Some of our veterans need to be seen often for their issues and it already takes entirely too long to receive in person care. Fck
        - Put pressure on congress, simple message:¬†Dethrone Trump. Fire him.

Everybody getting fucked by this needs to demand that their congressmen remove Trump. If not removed quickly he will never leave the presidency. Anybody aware of the threat, fired feds, betrayed farmers, anyone on Medicaid (1 in 5), and especially former Trump supporters must be directed to focus¬†all efforts¬†on republican congressman. Town halls,¬†every¬†public appearance, and protests outside of their offices.¬†

Protests will be used as an excuse to crack down, identify and jail dissidents. Protesting at a Tesla dealership won‚Äôt get Trump out of office, but it‚Äôll get you on an FBI list, so it‚Äôs imperative that effort be focused on one goal: flipping Republicans to remove Trump. ¬† ¬†
1% of Americans is 3 million, there are 535 congressmen, 218 Republicans in the house, 53 in the senate. This is doable. I know more than 1% of Americans want Trump gone before he destroys America.
        - Hey, remember when Trump said the VA was off limits from cuts? Who would have guessed that Trump lied?

At least that's something, I guess?

In any case, we'll see if Trump decides to Jackson this.

        - Dismantle and privatize.  Vets will be left to try and fend for themselves with private healthcare and mental health. Many times not available in rural America.

Even if they find care, how many are ready to help with ptsd, cronic illnesses from chemicals, burn pits etc.  

The vets in this country deserve better.
        - 83,000?!?

83,000 families suddenly looking for jobs as the number of jobs decrease because we're in a fucking trade war with our biggest trading partners
        - This is the party that claims they support the veterans.
        - Yet another thing republicans pretend to stand for but actually dont
        - So my wife is a Dr at the VA and has to schedule her patient's appointments because they don't have people to do that.  Let that sink in for a second.


Recently she was told that they're going to hold them to the same standard as private practice doctors, who have a support staff that does this kind of thing for them.  They're expected to be as efficient as private practice doctors but not get paid the same or have the same support staff. This is definitely not about efficiency.   If you care about veterans, complain because they're about to get fucked.
        - A lot of Veterans work at the VA...like wtf.
        - Cool, because who cares about getting prompt care for long-term service connected injuries? Some of our veterans need to be seen often for their issues and it already takes entirely too long to receive in person care. Fck
        - Put pressure on congress, simple message:¬†Dethrone Trump. Fire him.

Everybody getting fucked by this needs to demand that their congressmen remove Trump. If not removed quickly he will never leave the presidency. Anybody aware of the threat, fired feds, betrayed farmers, anyone on Medicaid (1 in 5), and especially former Trump supporters must be directed to focus¬†all efforts¬†on republican congressman. Town halls,¬†every¬†public appearance, and protests outside of their offices.¬†

Protests will be used as an excuse to crack down, identify and jail dissidents. Protesting at a Tesla dealership won‚Äôt get Trump out of office, but it‚Äôll get you on an FBI list, so it‚Äôs imperative that effort be focused on one goal: flipping Republicans to remove Trump. ¬† ¬†
1% of Americans is 3 million, there are 535 congressmen, 218 Republicans in the house, 53 in the senate. This is doable. I know more than 1% of Americans want Trump gone before he destroys America.
        - Hey, remember when Trump said the VA was off limits from cuts? Who would have guessed that Trump lied?
        - One third of the federal layoffs have been veterans too. Double whammy.

Must be a DEI hire ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
        - I'm curious why a non medical professional is allowed to have this cabinet position. There should be a law requiring MD or DO credentials. 

If a licensed doctor gave misinformation publicly, he could be sanctioned by the medical board, making the MD requirement a safeguard against abuse.
        - At a time when parents are staging measles parties, we need someone who advocates for proper prevention via vaccination. Instead we get this guy. The measles parties are absolutely insane to me, and I am so pissed at parents putting their kids at risk like that.
        - I love how Trump surrounds himself with the best and brightest people unlike Biden who chose merely competent people. /s
        - If only there was a way to prevent measles

gee, i wonder why the rest of the developed world doesnt have this problem
        - CEOs, politicians, public figures, etc, need to practice what they preach.  
  
RFK should host a measles party.   
Elon should try to live on a bus driver's wage.  
Marco Rubio should move to Ukraine.

Do that for a month and then we'll entertain your harebrained ideas.

        - "Charges against them include child endangerment and abuse, conspiracy, and battery, attorney general Rob Bonta's office announced in a press release on Monday.

...

...143 victims involved, ranging from 12 to 18 years old.

...

Twenty-two of the 30 officers charged were arraigned on Monday, meaning they formally faced their charges in court. 

The leaked video footage - published by the Los Angeles Times in April - shows a teen falling to the ground after sustaining punches and kicks from multiple others.

The other eight officers are scheduled to be arraigned in April.

"Officers at Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall have a duty to ensure the safety and well-being of those under their care," Mr Bonta said in the press release.

Instead, he continued, the officers charged were "overseeing 'gladiator fights' when they should have intervened".

...

One of the two teens was seen being attacked in the video footage, aged 16 at the time, said the teen's lawyer, Jamal Tooson.

Mr Tooson said the other teen he represents was attacked three times in one day at the facility, leaving the client unconscious and with traumatic brain injury."

Just disgusting.
        - Now we should put those 30 officers in a pit and fight each other. Last one standing gets pardoned
        - I've worked in Residential/Juvenile facilities and if you don't check the adults in charge it ALWAYS devolves into this
        - This happens alot more often than you think. I was in several ydc's. They like to call it hockey rules. The first one to hit the ground would be sent to the quiet room. The winner got a prize, usually a bag of chips.
        - That's evil. Not just criminal, but evil too.
        - We're locking up the right people?
        - I had a couple of friends who went to a military discipline school in the 8th - 9th grade

They talked about weekly "grudge matches" where the admin would line up the different dorms on the green, and go down the line asking who they had a grudge with

If you picked someone as a grudge, both boys would be brought to the center and have to fight, and if one boy chose you more than once, you had to fight more than once, which made your friends more likely to pick those and etx

One of those friends came back with hands like stone
        - What‚Äôs sad is people have been talking about it for decades, especially in Florida. My understanding is it‚Äôs gotten a little bit better down there at least. Lots of YouTube prison personalities share their experience in ‚ÄúGladiator School‚Äù. Pretty wild stuff.
        - If you just slap football pads and a helmet on them it‚Äôs looked at as totally fine.

        - Alito‚Äôs dissent is some choice bullshit. ‚ÄúHow dare a lower court override the president!‚Äù

The lower court found that congress had specified money to be spent, and the executive branch can‚Äôt just say ‚ÄúNah.‚Äù They can slow walk it, they can do some other shady shit - but in the end they gotta pay out that money. 

Alito‚Äôs so concerned about someone overturning the president he‚Äôs saying the statutes congress passed don‚Äôt matter.
        - Hallelujah. I haven‚Äôt been keeping up too much with which justices vote for what so maybe this is normal, but I was surprised to see Amy Coney Barrett voted with the liberal justices.
        - ‚ÄúFour of the court‚Äôs conservatives ‚Äî Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh ‚Äî dissented.‚Äù

These are the men who will dismantle our democracy. 

So shocked by Coney Barrett. I guess he does understand the Constitution and the benefit of rule of law. 

BTW- this ruling merely states that the USG must pay for work already done by implementers. This is money owed to them.
        - It‚Äôs kind of mind boggling that 4 Supreme Court Justices support the idea that the Executive branch can just deicide not to pay their bills when the Legislative branch has allocated the funding and the recipients have already done what they were to be paid to do.
        - So, it looks like this isn't a particularly strong ruling against Trump, despite the headline, given that it basically shifts responsibility back down to the lower court.

At least that's something, I guess?

In any case, we'll see if Trump decides to Jackson this.
        - Damn Justice Amy Coney Barrett doing justice.
        - That there are only five SCOTUS votes for paying congressionally mandated invoices for work *already* done!? This should be as basic a test of Article I as you can get. And that does not bode well for decisions to come
        - Sooo. Trump will still just not send the money, right?  Even so the damage has been done for a lot of these organisations.
        - These billions refer to services already rendered. Moving on, all future endeavours can be cancelled and nothing further must be paid.
        - You could pencil in Alito and Thomas on virtually any right wing wet dream . Gorsuch close behind.

        - Elect clowns, expect a circus.
        - This is what you MAGA fucks voted for.  Now we can all be sick, poor, and hated by the world. Good job, you assholes.
        - Nothing to see here, the brain worm is in command
        - It's beginning to feel like the Secretary of Health and Human Services doesn't know anything about health.

Must be a DEI hire ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
        - I'm curious why a non medical professional is allowed to have this cabinet position. There should be a law requiring MD or DO credentials. 

If a licensed doctor gave misinformation publicly, he could be sanctioned by the medical board, making the MD requirement a safeguard against abuse.
        - At a time when parents are staging measles parties, we need someone who advocates for proper prevention via vaccination. Instead we get this guy. The measles parties are absolutely insane to me, and I am so pissed at parents putting their kids at risk like that.
        - I love how Trump surrounds himself with the best and brightest people unlike Biden who chose merely competent people. /s
        - If only there was a way to prevent measles

gee, i wonder why the rest of the developed world doesnt have this problem
        - CEOs, politicians, public figures, etc, need to practice what they preach.  
  
RFK should host a measles party.   
Elon should try to live on a bus driver's wage.  
Marco Rubio should move to Ukraine.

Do that for a month and then we'll entertain your harebrained ideas.
        - No, see, to cure a deadly disease you don't need medicine or vaccines, you just need more Vitamin D.

        - I can't believe I'm actually rooting for Florida's attorney general.
        - Man, how bad are these guys that the AG of fucking FLORIDA is coming after them? Like, that's the pedophile human trafficker retirement home of the world!
        - Hell yeah, fuck this dude forever
        - Hopefully this won't be swept under the rug the way previous Florida attorney generals swept the Epstein and then Trump University investigations.
        - I truly don't understand this. But I'm supportive of criminals being prosecuted.
        - It‚Äôs pathetic they‚Äôre even here. They‚Äôre going to be used to indoctrinate an entire group of boys and young men with no strong male role model to help turn this country to shit.
        - Prediction: "After a thorough investigation, we've found no wrong-doing from Andrew and Tristan Tate and will not be pursuing any charges. In the eyes of the Florida legal system, we consider this case closed‚Äîand so should everyone else."
        - Good! Put some state charges and DeSantis can take credit for it for all I care when he runs for president. The GOP used to be for law and order, look at what it is now. State charges so that Orange Mussolini can‚Äôt pardon them.¬†
        - Of all the places in the world they could have gone to. They went to Florida.
        - So where's the investigation of Matt Gaetz??? Is he the guv's buddy or something?

28. [RISING] Trump Suddenly Reverses Order on Mass Firing of Federal Employees

        - So is this the part where they try to rehire people and put them through political screening first? Or is this the part where they pretend like the mass firings never happened so that they can't get sued?
        - "The¬†[memo](https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=https://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/athena/files/2025/03/04/67c74950e4b0b4e940709591.pdf)¬†states that instead, federal offices now have until September 13 to determine how to reduce staff."

Not reversed but delayed. IE my bullshit is tanking the economy so we need to spread out the bullshit.
        - He will reverse it again.
        - How much more evidence does anyone need that *these fucking idiots have no idea what they‚Äôre doing, and have no actual plan*?
        - Trump is not mentally capable to manage a small convenient store.

What kind of president is this?
        - Whether he reverses it again or not - hopefully by now people can see this man and his cabinet are not qualified. They are not working in the interests of Americans who elected confessional representatives for the services they wanted and needed. 

People can disagree about what those are and what extent they should be - but for one man to appoint an unelected man who was *not* vetted by Congress to just fire people or remove entire sections of government established to serve the citizens proves Trump and his group are not just unqualified but dangerous idiots who serve corporate, billionaire, and Russian interests before ours. 

If your house and senators oppose impeaching him and his crew - then it should be the obligation of every American to make it clear *their* jobs are on the line.
        - it would be hilarious if he blames Elon for the stock market tanking and puts apartheid clyde in jail.
        - At this point, can we 25th amendment him? He clearly has no idea WTF he's doing.
        - THE ARTICLE TITLE IS MISLEADING AND A LIE. 

Trump didnt do anything and the EOs and Presidential memorandums directing for a massive downsizing of the federal government are still in place. All that happened was that the Office of Personnel and Management (OPM), which is kinda like the whole governments HR and who makes policies, rescinded a memo that they wrote implementing the Presidential EOs and Memoranda. This was done because OPM can‚Äôt legally tell other departments to fire people and the Courts have pointed that out in some injunctions and court cases that have been brought. 

THIS MEMO BEING RESCINDED DOES NOTHING OTHER THAN TELL AGENCIES THEY NEED TO MAKE THE DETERMINATION TO FIRE PROBATIONARY (new) EMPLOYEES ‚ÄòTHEMSELVES‚Äô. The government is still going to fire all these new employees just it would be at ‚Äòagency discretion‚Äô.  And just removes a very low hanging fruit for these wrongfully terminated employees to be fired over. 

and we are already seeing this happen. The DoD yesterday signed a memo that says ‚Äú the Department is taking independent steps to reduce the size of the civilian workforce.‚Äù
        - That‚Äôs what we call an admission of failure

        - Dismantle and privatize.  Vets will be left to try and fend for themselves with private healthcare and mental health. Many times not available in rural America.

Even if they find care, how many are ready to help with ptsd, cronic illnesses from chemicals, burn pits etc.  

The vets in this country deserve better.
        - 83,000?!?

83,000 families suddenly looking for jobs as the number of jobs decrease because we're in a fucking trade war with our biggest trading partners
        - This is the party that claims they support the veterans.
        - Yet another thing republicans pretend to stand for but actually dont
        - So my wife is a Dr at the VA and has to schedule her patient's appointments because they don't have people to do that.  Let that sink in for a second.


Recently she was told that they're going to hold them to the same standard as private practice doctors, who have a support staff that does this kind of thing for them.  They're expected to be as efficient as private practice doctors but not get paid the same or have the same support staff. This is definitely not about efficiency.   If you care about veterans, complain because they're about to get fucked.
        - A lot of Veterans work at the VA...like wtf.
        - Cool, because who cares about getting prompt care for long-term service connected injuries? Some of our veterans need to be seen often for their issues and it already takes entirely too long to receive in person care. Fck
        - Put pressure on congress, simple message:¬†Dethrone Trump. Fire him.

Everybody getting fucked by this needs to demand that their congressmen remove Trump. If not removed quickly he will never leave the presidency. Anybody aware of the threat, fired feds, betrayed farmers, anyone on Medicaid (1 in 5), and especially former Trump supporters must be directed to focus¬†all efforts¬†on republican congressman. Town halls,¬†every¬†public appearance, and protests outside of their offices.¬†

Protests will be used as an excuse to crack down, identify and jail dissidents. Protesting at a Tesla dealership won‚Äôt get Trump out of office, but it‚Äôll get you on an FBI list, so it‚Äôs imperative that effort be focused on one goal: flipping Republicans to remove Trump. ¬† ¬†
1% of Americans is 3 million, there are 535 congressmen, 218 Republicans in the house, 53 in the senate. This is doable. I know more than 1% of Americans want Trump gone before he destroys America.
        - Hey, remember when Trump said the VA was off limits from cuts? Who would have guessed that Trump lied?
        - One third of the federal layoffs have been veterans too. Double whammy.

        - Few weeks after this happens one Ukrainian sergeant meets an Aussie fellow soldier on the frontline. The sergeant asks: ‚ÄúHello fellow soldier, did you come here to die?‚Äù To which the Aussie soldier replies ‚ÄúNah sir, came here yesterday‚Äù.
        - Should send Cassowaries. They attack anything.
        - So now we have three countries who said they'll do it: France (Macron said he'll also send troops if Russia gets close to Kyiv), UK, Australia, and another five who are likely to do it (probably Finland and the Baltics). Not bad.
        - It‚Äôs amazing to me that Trump - a guy who prides himself as a master dealmaker - is willing to go down as a failure in dealmaking with Ukraine‚Äôs fate.
        - Send in the emus. The emu army has never lost a war.
        - Just a note to JD Vance before he adds us to the list of random countries that havent fought a war in 30 years, 41 dead in Afghanistan.
        - They should make Gina Rinehart pay for helping Ukraine
        - Good. Stand up to Putin. Peacekeeping isn‚Äôt just an option‚Äîit‚Äôs a necessity. Dictators only back down when democracies show strength. No hesitation, no half-measures.
        - I wish Canada üá®üá¶ would also.  I'd enlist tomorrow.
        - They can practice already in Bali and Phuket if they want, plenty of Aussie and Ruski there and it's closer to home üòÖ
