Well, that's something, isn't it.
        - Just in case anyone believed that it was ever actually about the money and not an ideological desire to support Russia in the war.
        - Sooner or later the US will share their intelligence support to its new closest ally: Russia.

Not reversed but delayed. IE my bullshit is tanking the economy so we need to spread out the bullshit.

        - Dismantle and privatize.  Vets will be left to try and fend for themselves with private healthcare and mental health. Many times not available in rural America.

Even if they find care, how many are ready to help with ptsd, cronic illnesses from chemicals, burn pits etc.  

The vets in this country deserve better.
        - 83,000?!?

83,000 families suddenly looking for jobs as the number of jobs decrease because we're in a fucking trade war with our biggest trading partners
        - This is the party that claims they support the veterans.
        - Yet another thing republicans pretend to stand for but actually dont
        - So my wife is a Dr at the VA and has to schedule her patient's appointments because they don't have people to do that.  Let that sink in for a second.


Recently she was told that they're going to hold them to the same standard as private practice doctors, who have a support staff that does this kind of thing for them.  They're expected to be as efficient as private practice doctors but not get paid the same or have the same support staff. This is definitely not about efficiency.   If you care about veterans, complain because they're about to get fucked.

        - Should send Cassowaries. They attack anything.
        - So now we have three countries who said they'll do it: France (Macron said he'll also send troops if Russia gets close to Kyiv), UK, Australia, and another five who are likely to do it (probably Finland and the Baltics). Not bad.
        - Send in the emus. The emu army has never lost a war.
        - It‚Äôs amazing to me that Trump - a guy who prides himself as a master dealmaker - is willing to go down as a failure in dealmaking with Ukraine‚Äôs fate.

Long-term is another story China has five times the population and has much better control over their population. While the US would struggle with mass protests China would have no problem recruiting millions of soldiers. They even have a surplus of men of fighting age due to the ridiculous one child policy.  War with China would hurt the US much more than it would hurt China.

        - Alito‚Äôs dissent is some choice bullshit. ‚ÄúHow dare a lower court override the president!‚Äù

The lower court found that congress had specified money to be spent, and the executive branch can‚Äôt just say ‚ÄúNah.‚Äù They can slow walk it, they can do some other shady shit - but in the end they gotta pay out that money. 

Alito‚Äôs so concerned about someone overturning the president he‚Äôs saying the statutes congress passed don‚Äôt matter.
        - Hallelujah. I haven‚Äôt been keeping up too much with which justices vote for what so maybe this is normal, but I was surprised to see Amy Coney Barrett voted with the liberal justices.
        - ‚ÄúFour of the court‚Äôs conservatives ‚Äî Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh ‚Äî dissented.‚Äù

These are the men who will dismantle our democracy. 

So shocked by Coney Barrett. I guess he does understand the Constitution and the benefit of rule of law. 

BTW- this ruling merely states that the USG must pay for work already done by implementers. This is money owed to them.
        - So, it looks like this isn't a particularly strong ruling against Trump, despite the headline, given that it basically shifts responsibility back down to the lower court.

At least that's something, I guess?

In any case, we'll see if Trump decides to Jackson this.
        - Damn Justice Amy Coney Barrett doing justice.

        - "Charges against them include child endangerment and abuse, conspiracy, and battery, attorney general Rob Bonta's office announced in a press release on Monday.

...

...143 victims involved, ranging from 12 to 18 years old.

...

Twenty-two of the 30 officers charged were arraigned on Monday, meaning they formally faced their charges in court. 

The leaked video footage - published by the Los Angeles Times in April - shows a teen falling to the ground after sustaining punches and kicks from multiple others.

The other eight officers are scheduled to be arraigned in April.

"Officers at Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall have a duty to ensure the safety and well-being of those under their care," Mr Bonta said in the press release.

Instead, he continued, the officers charged were "overseeing 'gladiator fights' when they should have intervened".

...

One of the two teens was seen being attacked in the video footage, aged 16 at the time, said the teen's lawyer, Jamal Tooson.

Mr Tooson said the other teen he represents was attacked three times in one day at the facility, leaving the client unconscious and with traumatic brain injury."

Just disgusting.
        - Now we should put those 30 officers in a pit and fight each other. Last one standing gets pardoned
        - I've worked in Residential/Juvenile facilities and if you don't check the adults in charge it ALWAYS devolves into this
        - This happens alot more often than you think. I was in several ydc's. They like to call it hockey rules. The first one to hit the ground would be sent to the quiet room. The winner got a prize, usually a bag of chips.

        - On the positive side, it‚Äôs only a dozen or so. It‚Äôs incredibly contagious, so if vaccination rates weren‚Äôt very high, we‚Äôd be seeing those numbers skyrocketing. 

Although, this might just be due to underreporting.
        - None of this should be happening at all!  We figured this stuff out decades ago!
Growing up, my family never once worried about measles, diptheria, polio.  You know, child killers.

Because we were vaccinated as infants or school aged children.  This is so stupid and unnecessary
        - Is that bad? That seems bad.
        - This is more than 100 new cases since the update on February 18th, two weeks ago.

Fortunately, reported cases seem to be getting added at a slower pace  than previous weeks.

The update prior to this one added 22 cases. The two updates prior to that each added 30+ cases to the total case count.

Seems the local public health authorities and medical professionals may be getting a handle on the outbreak. The fewer cases, the better, especially considering children have been most affected.
        - Isn‚Äôt measles devastating on foeti? Fetuses?

        - Virginia's governor had a whole press conference where he unveiled this website to help federal workers who had been laid off to find new jobs. 

The website is literally just links to LinkedIn and Indeed.
        - Our country is being crippled by the current administration and our economy is in a downward spiral. Of course there are fewer jobs being offered.
        - Did you like the Great Depression? Well, good news, it's back! We've got isolationism! We've got protectionism! We've got the rise of fascism! All the greatest hits!
        - Giant agribusiness Corp I'm at is on an indefinite hiring freeze because of tariffs. Guess where their PAC $ went.

        - Alito‚Äôs dissent is some choice bullshit. ‚ÄúHow dare a lower court override the president!‚Äù

The lower court found that congress had specified money to be spent, and the executive branch can‚Äôt just say ‚ÄúNah.‚Äù They can slow walk it, they can do some other shady shit - but in the end they gotta pay out that money. 

Alito‚Äôs so concerned about someone overturning the president he‚Äôs saying the statutes congress passed don‚Äôt matter.
        - ‚ÄúFour of the court‚Äôs conservatives ‚Äî Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh ‚Äî dissented.‚Äù

These are the men who will dismantle our democracy. 

So shocked by Coney Barrett. I guess he does understand the Constitution and the benefit of rule of law. 

BTW- this ruling merely states that the USG must pay for work already done by implementers. This is money owed to them.
        - Hallelujah. I haven‚Äôt been keeping up too much with which justices vote for what so maybe this is normal, but I was surprised to see Amy Coney Barrett voted with the liberal justices.
        - So, it looks like this isn't a particularly strong ruling against Trump, despite the headline, given that it basically shifts responsibility back down to the lower court.

At least that's something, I guess?

In any case, we'll see if Trump decides to Jackson this.
        - Damn Justice Amy Coney Barrett doing justice.

        - Elect clowns, expect a circus.
        - This is what you MAGA fucks voted for.  Now we can all be sick, poor, and hated by the world. Good job, you assholes.
        - Nothing to see here, the brain worm is in command
        - It's beginning to feel like the Secretary of Health and Human Services doesn't know anything about health.

Must be a DEI hire ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
        - I'm curious why a non medical professional is allowed to have this cabinet position. There should be a law requiring MD or DO credentials. 

If a licensed doctor gave misinformation publicly, he could be sanctioned by the medical board, making the MD requirement a safeguard against abuse.

        - I can't believe I'm actually rooting for Florida's attorney general.
        - Man, how bad are these guys that the AG of fucking FLORIDA is coming after them? Like, that's the pedophile human trafficker retirement home of the world!
        - Hell yeah, fuck this dude forever
        - Hopefully this won't be swept under the rug the way previous Florida attorney generals swept the Epstein and then Trump University investigations.
        - I truly don't understand this. But I'm supportive of criminals being prosecuted.

        - To the brave Ukrainian troops, well done (from the US with shameful apologies for our president and his party of cowards)
        - What was it Trump said? 3 days?

What was it Putin said? 2 weeks?
        - Brave courageous Ukrainians, fighting for all our freedom.

        - So is this the part where they try to rehire people and put them through political screening first? Or is this the part where they pretend like the mass firings never happened so that they can't get sued?
        - "The¬†[memo](https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=https://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/athena/files/2025/03/04/67c74950e4b0b4e940709591.pdf)¬†states that instead, federal offices now have until September 13 to determine how to reduce staff."

Not reversed but delayed. IE my bullshit is tanking the economy so we need to spread out the bullshit.
        - He will reverse it again.
        - How much more evidence does anyone need that *these fucking idiots have no idea what they‚Äôre doing, and have no actual plan*?
        - Trump is not mentally capable to manage a small convenient store.

What kind of president is this?

        - Dismantle and privatize.  Vets will be left to try and fend for themselves with private healthcare and mental health. Many times not available in rural America.

Even if they find care, how many are ready to help with ptsd, cronic illnesses from chemicals, burn pits etc.  

The vets in this country deserve better.
        - 83,000?!?

83,000 families suddenly looking for jobs as the number of jobs decrease because we're in a fucking trade war with our biggest trading partners
        - This is the party that claims they support the veterans.
        - Yet another thing republicans pretend to stand for but actually dont
        - So my wife is a Dr at the VA and has to schedule her patient's appointments because they don't have people to do that.  Let that sink in for a second.


Recently she was told that they're going to hold them to the same standard as private practice doctors, who have a support staff that does this kind of thing for them.  They're expected to be as efficient as private practice doctors but not get paid the same or have the same support staff. This is definitely not about efficiency.   If you care about veterans, complain because they're about to get fucked.

        - Few weeks after this happens one Ukrainian sergeant meets an Aussie fellow soldier on the frontline. The sergeant asks: ‚ÄúHello fellow soldier, did you come here to die?‚Äù To which the Aussie soldier replies ‚ÄúNah sir, came here yesterday‚Äù.
        - Should send Cassowaries. They attack anything.
        - So now we have three countries who said they'll do it: France (Macron said he'll also send troops if Russia gets close to Kyiv), UK, Australia, and another five who are likely to do it (probably Finland and the Baltics). Not bad.
        - Send in the emus. The emu army has never lost a war.
        - It‚Äôs amazing to me that Trump - a guy who prides himself as a master dealmaker - is willing to go down as a failure in dealmaking with Ukraine‚Äôs fate.
