        - &gt;In the lead up to Trump‚Äôs inauguration, Ratcliffe and the Trump transition team were told of the value of intelligence sharing with Ukraine by US officials who stressed that it was a hallmark of their achievements on the battlefield, according to a source familiar with the discussions.

Well, that's something, isn't it.
        - Just in case anyone believed that it was ever actually about the money and not an ideological desire to support Russia in the war.
        - Sooner or later the US will share their intelligence support to its new closest ally: Russia.
        - Better headline:  
\&gt; Russian Agent has paused US intelligence sharing with Ukraine
        - If not Russian asset, why Russian asset shaped?

        - Elect clowns, expect a circus.
        - This is what you MAGA fucks voted for.  Now we can all be sick, poor, and hated by the world. Good job, you assholes.
        - Nothing to see here, the brain worm is in command
        - It's beginning to feel like the Secretary of Health and Human Services doesn't know anything about health.

Must be a DEI hire ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
        - I'm curious why a non medical professional is allowed to have this cabinet position. There should be a law requiring MD or DO credentials. 

If a licensed doctor gave misinformation publicly, he could be sanctioned by the medical board, making the MD requirement a safeguard against abuse.

        - I can't believe I'm actually rooting for Florida's attorney general.
        - Man, how bad are these guys that the AG of fucking FLORIDA is coming after them? Like, that's the pedophile human trafficker retirement home of the world!
        - Hell yeah, fuck this dude forever
        - Hopefully this won't be swept under the rug the way previous Florida attorney generals swept the Epstein and then Trump University investigations.
        - I truly don't understand this. But I'm supportive of criminals being prosecuted.

        - To the brave Ukrainian troops, well done (from the US with shameful apologies for our president and his party of cowards)
        - What was it Trump said? 3 days?

What was it Putin said? 2 weeks?
        - Brave courageous Ukrainians, fighting for all our freedom.
        - Slava Ukraini! Heroyam Slava!

        - So is this the part where they try to rehire people and put them through political screening first? Or is this the part where they pretend like the mass firings never happened so that they can't get sued?
        - "The¬†[memo](https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=https://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/athena/files/2025/03/04/67c74950e4b0b4e940709591.pdf)¬†states that instead, federal offices now have until September 13 to determine how to reduce staff."

Not reversed but delayed. IE my bullshit is tanking the economy so we need to spread out the bullshit.
        - He will reverse it again.
        - How much more evidence does anyone need that *these fucking idiots have no idea what they‚Äôre doing, and have no actual plan*?
        - Trump is not mentally capable to manage a small convenient store.

What kind of president is this?

        - Feel like lots of people cheering on the federal government layoffs are going to be in for a rude awakening when suddenly there's 10x as many people applying for each open private sector job.
        - Virginia's governor had a whole press conference where he unveiled this website to help federal workers who had been laid off to find new jobs. 

The website is literally just links to LinkedIn and Indeed.
        - Y‚Äôall better buckle tf up because we are headed straight for a massive recession. 

‚úÖHundreds of thousands of newly out of work employees competing for a shrinking pool of private sector jobs

‚úÖTariffs causing inflation 

‚úÖGovernment accountability and enforcement on financial institutions becoming non-existent

Cannot overstate how perfect of an economic storm is brewing right now. But thank god the right finally owned us queer-loving liberal pansies.
        - Our country is being crippled by the current administration and our economy is in a downward spiral. Of course there are fewer jobs being offered.
        - This is exactly what so many people wanted. 

To get fired from their well paying and financially sound government employment so they can : *checks notes* work at Home Depot. 

Awesome.
